# AGENTS.md: museum website template

One-page website for a museum with free halls, a main exhibition, collection tours, learning sessions and membership. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:navigation`: `.nav__bar` `.nav__overlay` `.nav__menu-btn` `.nav__close`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.ct-status` `data-sent` `data-missing`
  - `scene:halls`: `.hl-stage` `.hl-track` `.hl-hall` `.hl-plate` `.hl-name` `.m-stroke`
  - `scene:exhibition`: `.ex-print` `.ex-sep--c` `.ex-sep--m` `.ex-sep--y` `.ex-true` `.ex-w--1` `.ex-w--2`
  - `scene:drawers`: `.dr-drawer` `.dr-tray`
  - `scene:learn`: `.ln-tray` `.ln-card`
  - `scene:lates`: `.lt-photo` `.lt-list` `.lt-glow`
  - `scene:visit`: `.vs-photo` `.vs-body` `.vs-col`
  - `scene:contact`: `.ct-grid` `.ct-col`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Flight` is 6, `Insects` is 7, `Deep time` is 9, `Tide line` is 9, `Plants` is 6, `Mammals` is 7, `The Colour` is 10, `of Flight` is 9, `Learn` is 5, `Lates` is 5, `Wrenfield` is 9.
- The big hall names, the two exhibition title lines, the Learn heading, the Lates word and the footer wordmark use style="--len:N" (the number of characters) to size the type. Update it when you rename a hall, the exhibition or the museum: each has its own.
- The opening shows one plate twice, as the ink layer and again inside the amber colour layer that covers it; both use the same photo address. If you change the plate, change both, and keep the alt text only on the first.
- The exhibition plate is one photo shown four times (three colour-filtered copies and the true image); the filters are SVG matrices defined at the top of the section. Use the same photo address in all four.
- The yellow strokes are empty spans coloured by --color-4, and the two glyphs in the field section are text characters (+ and ≈) in --color-3; recolour them through the palette variables.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #5995a8 (teal page ground of the halls, sessions and contact sections, the solid nav bar and the frame under the two lens photos), `--color-2` #ffffff (the large uppercase words and text on the deep teal blocks, the exhibition print sheet), `--color-3` #0d1f2b (body text, the nav, the menu overlay and the ground of the exhibition, Lates, FAQ and footer), `--color-4` #eab12f (yellow accent: filled buttons, grown underlines, nav hover bar, Lates glow, FAQ plus marks), `--color-5` #f6d97c (pale yellow ground of the field section and the lens discs, and the fill that floods outlined buttons on hover), `--color-6` #c97f1c (amber ground of the membership section and of the whole opening, where it tints the plate, and the opening panel on phones), `--color-7` #e9f2f4 (pale ice ground of the drawers and visit sections, session cards, membership labels and specimen label); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, social, map, form, phone, email): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Plan your visit button in the opening and the Book a free ticket icon in the top bar: now #visit; owner's target: your ticketing page (Eventbrite, Ticketsolve) or keep it on the visit section.
- Book the exhibition, Book a drawer tour, Book a free ticket, the Tickets links of the Lates, the four session links (Book a place, Apply for a term, Plan a class visit), and the Join and Adopt buttons: now #visit or #contact on the page; owner's target: the booking, ticket or donation page for each (a ticketing tool, a membership form, a payment link).
- Instagram and YouTube icons in the top bar, and the Instagram link in the footer: now the home pages instagram.com and youtube.com; owner's target: your museum's profile and channel.
- Open the map button in the visit section: now the OpenStreetMap home page; owner's target: the map link of your building.
- Send and Subscribe buttons in the contact forms: now nothing is sent: both forms have action="#contact" and a script shows the status line; owner's target: your form endpoint (Formspree, Netlify Forms) and your newsletter service.
- The Volunteer link in the footer: now #contact; owner's target: your volunteering page or email.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `email`, `message`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` validates it and shows the thank-you text. Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `newsletter`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` validates it and shows the thank-you text. Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Wrenfield Museum of Natural History (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (20, Unsplash: opening 1, halls 6, exhibition 1, drawers 4, field 1, learn 4, lates 1, support 1, visit 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Known limits
- Lighthouse lists gsap and ScrollTrigger as render-blocking; they sit at the end of body and the motion scripts need them loaded.
- Without JavaScript the phone menu button cannot open the overlay (the footer still links Halls, Exhibition, Collections and Learn, and the ticket icon goes to Visit), and both forms reload the page with the fields in the address instead of showing the status line; the five links stay in the top bar on desktop and the FAQ opens natively.
- With reduced motion the scenes and Lenis are off and the halls become a plain grid, but the bar still hides on scroll down and the nav changes as you scroll.
- On phones the hall panels keep a contained plate size, which leaves empty space between each plate and its text.
- Both forms only validate and show a status line; they need a real endpoint before launch.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Wrenfield Museum of Natural History left only in class names.
