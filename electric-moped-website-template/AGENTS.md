# AGENTS.md: electric moped website template

One-page website for an electric moped maker or dealer selling three models, with buy or monthly plans, kerbside service and a test ride form. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:nav`: `.nav__menu` `.nav__close`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.ct__form` `.ct__done` `.ct__error`
  - `scene:models`: `.mo__stage` `.mo__item` `.mo__thumb` `.mo__photo` `.mo__info`
  - `scene:battery`: `.ba__segs` `.ba__tick` `.ba__rig` `.ba__cell` `.ba__last`
  - `scene:details`: `.de__strips` `.de__cap` `.de__stage`
  - `scene:routes`: `.ro__route` `.ro__rider` `.ro__stop` `.ro__dot` `.ro__fill` `.ro__stage`
  - `scene:service`: `.se__sticky` `.se__track` `.se__stage`
  - `scene:reviews`: `.rv__grid`
  - `scene:footer`: `.ft__mark`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Hear the city,` is 14, `not the engine.` is 15, `Arco.` is 5.
- The two headline lines in the first screen and the footer wordmark use style="--len:N" (their character count) to fit the width: change N whenever you change the words.
- The models scene is built for exactly three models and the routes scene pairs five stops with five day dots; the map labels are placed by percentage to match the SVG circles, so move a stop and its label together.
- The battery, the street map, the charge bar and the logo mark are CSS or SVG, not images: recolour them through the colour variables in :root, which keep the single red accent.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #e9eaec (page ground, the nav bar and the phone menu overlay), `--color-2` #d4d6d8 (grey panels and photo placeholders, the Own it plan, model badges, river and street lines on the map), `--color-3` #ffffff (pill cards, the Ride monthly plan, question rows, the street map ground, the second-style buttons), `--color-4` #121316 (text, the main buttons, the battery section ground, the route line, map labels), `--color-5` #555960 (secondary text: leads, descriptions, captions, field labels), `--color-6` #cc2c24 (the only accent: button icon discs, charge segments, route rider, review stars, list markers, the wordmark full stop), `--color-7` #a2a6ad (paragraph text and the slot label on the dark battery section), `--color-8` #24262b (battery cell, handle and slot, and the time rules on the dark section), `--color-9` #b9bdc3 (hairlines between specs, plan items and footer, and form field borders); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, phone, form, email): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Book a ride button in the nav, Book a test ride in the phone menu, in the first screen, in the Own it plan and in the footer, Start monthly in the Ride monthly plan: now #contact; owner's target: your online test ride booking page, or keep #contact once the form is connected.
- Ride an Uno, Ride a Nero and Ride an Argento buttons in the models section: now #contact (the form's Model select is not preselected); owner's target: a booking page per model, or keep #contact and preselect the model in the form.
- Call us button in the nav, the phone link in the phone menu, the Still unsure? caption in the questions, the Call pill in the contact section and the footer phone link: now tel: link to the placeholder number; owner's target: your real phone number in tel: form (+44...) and the visible form.
- Write pill in the contact section and the email in the footer: now mailto: link to the placeholder address; owner's target: your real sales or booking email.
- Contact form (Book my ride): now action="#" with nothing sent; the script only checks name, phone and email and shows the thank-you line; owner's target: a form service endpoint (Formspree, Netlify Forms) or your booking system.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `phone`, `email`, `model`, `day`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` validates it and shows the thank-you text. Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Arco (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (15, Unsplash: opening 1, models 3, workshop 1, details 3, service 2, faq 1, reviews 4, contact 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

- Place and company: Bristol, the shop address, the phone, the email, the company name "Arco Electric Ltd, registered in England" and the copyright year (contact, footer).

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the phone menu button cannot open the overlay; the footer repeats Models, Plans, Battery, Range, Service and Questions, so phones can still reach them. The contact form cannot show its thank-you line.
- The nav links on desktop leave out Plans and Questions; they are reachable in the phone overlay and in the footer.
- Four pinned scenes (models, details, routes, service) hold the screen for about two screens of scrolling each; they are sized for ordinary screens and are not tuned for short landscape phones.
- The same moped photo is used for the first screen, the thumbnail stack and the Uno row, so changing the first model means changing three images.
- Five scripts load from a CDN without defer (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, SplitText, MotionPathPlugin and Lenis) at the end of the page, so they must be reachable for the animations.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Arco left only in class names.
