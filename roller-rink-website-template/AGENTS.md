# AGENTS.md: roller rink website template

One-page website for a roller rink or skating venue that runs weekly sessions, lessons, parties and a record booth. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:nav`: `.nav__toggle` `.menu__close`
  - `section-script:booth`: `.bo-form` `.bo-msg` `.bo-ok` `.bo-empty`
  - `scene:sessions`: `.ss-list` `.ss-row` `.ss-day` `.ss-time` `.m-badge` `.ss-head` `.ss-foot` `.ss-what`
  - `scene:lessons`: `.ls-steps` `.ls-step`
  - `scene:seasons`: `.se-track` `.se-viewport`
  - `scene:booth`: `.bo-crates` `.bo-sleeve`
  - `scene:contact`: `.ct-map` `.ct-zoom` `.ct-route-cream` `.ct-route-ink`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Spinway` is 7.
- The wordmark in the footer takes its size from style="--len:7", the number of characters of "Spinway"; update it with the new name. The nav and menu wordmarks and the map label are plain text.
- The lessons grid has four columns and each step carries style="--ls-n:N" (1 to 4) for its stepped height: keep four steps or change the grid and the numbers together. The booth scene stacks any number of sleeves, but the copy speaks of four crates. The five session rows are measured by the sessions scene, so keep the rows' day, time and price elements.
- The wheel circles, the stripes, the map and the record rings are CSS and SVG, not images: recolour them through the colour variables in :root.
- The seasons track is measured from its width, so any number of years works, but each item keeps the year, title, text and photo order.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #0b5f7f (teal ground of the lessons and booth sections, the Saturday session row and the teal wheel in the rental rows), `--color-2` #3b2e47 (aubergine ground of the first screen, phone menu, rental and contact sections), `--color-3` #f3e6cf (cream text, photo frames, rules, outlines and the cream bars between stripes), `--color-4` #f5a524 (yellow ground of the floor and questions sections, primary buttons, the first session row and the footer wordmark), `--color-5` #ee5a2a (orange ground of the seasons section, button hover, the second session row and the map route), `--color-6` #b8301a (red in the stripes, the red wheel, the third lesson step and the largest party panel), `--color-7` #271e30 (ink page ground for sessions, parties and footer, and dark text on the yellow and orange sections); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, email, form, phone, social): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Book a party button in the nav, the first link of the phone menu and the first screen's secondary button: now #parties; owner's target: your party booking page, or keep #parties and connect the Ask for a date button.
- Ask for a date button in the parties section: now a mailto link to the parties email address; owner's target: your party enquiry form or booking page, or your real parties email.
- This week’s sessions button on the first screen: now #sessions; owner's target: keep it, or link to an online ticket page for the week.
- Plan your visit button in the sessions section: now #contact; owner's target: your directions or ticket page, or keep #contact.
- Join the next course button in the lessons section: now #contact; owner's target: your lesson sign-up page or form.
- Phone and email links in the Call or write block: now a tel link and a mailto link with placeholder details; owner's target: your real phone number and email address.
- Send to the booth button (record request form): now nothing is sent: a script shows a thank-you line on the page; owner's target: a form endpoint (Formspree, Netlify Forms or your own) or remove the form.
- The form in `#booth` (fields `request`) sends nothing; `section-script:booth` validates it and shows the thank-you text. Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Spinway Roller Rink (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (16, Unsplash: opening 2, floor 1, lessons 1, skates 2, seasons 8, parties 1, booth 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for
All demo text, never to be invented:

- Hours: the box office opens thirty minutes before each session and is closed Mondays (contact).
- Safety rules: helmets required for under-twelves and lent free, no metal toe stops, no street shoes on the floor (faq, floor).
- Social profiles: the Instagram and Facebook links point to the networks' home pages (footer).

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the phone menu button cannot open the overlay, and the record form shows no confirmation. The five main sections stay reachable through the footer links and fifty seasons through the first screen's link; the record booth has no other link on phones.
- On phones the sessions scene runs unpinned and the per-row descriptions are hidden under 900 px; only day, time, price and the title show.
- The seasons and booth scenes pin the section for several screens of scroll, which feels long on short phone screens.
- The page loads GSAP, ScrollTrigger and Lenis from jsDelivr; if the CDN fails, no scroll motion runs and the page shows its static layout. Self-host them if you need offline use.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Spinway Roller Rink left only in class names.
