# AGENTS.md: ceramic tile website template

One-page website for a tile maker or ceramics studio that sells custom glazed tiles to homes, cafes and trade. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:navigation`: `.nav__menu` `.nav__close` `.nav__overlay`
  - `section-script:opening`: `.rotor`
  - `section-script:maker`: `.mk-form` `.mk-preview` `data-out` `.m-swatch` `.m-swatch__name` `data-core` `data-price` `data-extra`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.ct-form` `.ct-status`
  - `scene:opening`: `.op-field` `.c` `.op-plate` `.rotor`
  - `scene:patterns`: `.pt-tile` `.pt-list`
  - `scene:making`: `.mg-stage` `.mg-track` `.mg-tile` `.mg-clay--dry` `.mg-clay--wet` `.mg-raw--frame` `.mg-raw--core` `.mg-window`
  - `scene:samples`: `.sm-board` `.sm-slot`
  - `scene:trade`: `.tr-sq` `.tr-sizes`
  - `scene:contact`: `.ct-band--`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Inset` is 5.
- The tile is drawn in CSS from three nested squares, and its colours come from the variables --a (frame) and --b (core) set inline on each tile and swatch; recolour the palette in :root (--color-3 to --color-14 are the glazes) and rename the glazes together in the glaze wall, the pairing notes, the designer swatches (both rows), the designer's default summary, the project captions and the patterns and making texts that name them.
- Counts the layout and scripts depend on: thirteen glaze tiles on a 7 column wall; a floor of 36 tiles in 6 columns for the patterns scene (the checker start comes from nth-child rules for 6 columns, and the script reads the columns and rows from the rendered grid); a 5 by 5 preview floor in the designer; eight tiles on the 3 column puzzle board (the script's scramble assumes it); three size cards (phone CSS places their drawings by nth-child, and the script nests the squares around the middle one); six projects and eight chips placed by --c, --r, --s (desktop) and --mc, --mr, --ms (phone) custom properties on each item. The making track measures its own width, so steps can be added.
- The designer reads data-price on each size and data-extra and data-core on each inlay (core size in percent, extra price in euros); keep those attributes when changing prices or options.
- The footer wordmark is sized from style="--len:5", the number of characters of "Inset"; update it when you rename the brand.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #ffffff (page ground, the headline plate, tile rings, text on the navy panels, form fields), `--color-2` #0a1a35 (body text, buttons and the outlined button's hover fill, the 2px rules, the navy panels, the Night glaze), `--color-3` #b8144a (Raspberry glaze, the filled button's hover fill, focus outline, list bullets, the logo mark's core, the top contact band), `--color-4` #74152a (Claret glaze), `--color-5` #c22a26 (Signal glaze), `--color-6` #ef6420 (Tangerine glaze), `--color-7` #ebb52a (Marigold glaze, the designer's default core, the thank-you line, the right contact band, focus outline on navy), `--color-8` #a6772b (Ochre glaze), `--color-9` #17853a (Fern glaze, the designer's default frame, the left contact band), `--color-10` #0b4a66 (Harbour glaze and the secondary text: pairing notes, spec labels, step numbers, layout descriptions, footer lines), `--color-11` #0a4597 (Cobalt glaze, the second colour of the patterns floor, the core of the fired tile, the bottom contact band), `--color-12` #0b9ad6 (Lido glaze), `--color-13` #a5c5c9 (Mist glaze and the backgrounds behind photos while they load), `--color-14` #7a96b4 (Slate glaze); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, form, phone, email, social): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Sample box button in the nav: now #samples; owner's target: your sample order page or shop.
- Design your tile and Order samples buttons in the first screen: now #maker and #samples; owner's target: keep, or point to your configurator and sample shop.
- Put it in a sample box button under the tile designer, and Build your box in the samples section: now #samples and #maker; owner's target: your checkout or an order form that receives the chosen frame, core, inlay and size (the designer form posts nothing).
- Order the studio mix link and Ask for a trade account button: now #contact; owner's target: your order page or trade account form.
- Send to the studio button in the contact form: now submits to the same page; nothing is sent, a script shows the thank-you line; owner's target: your form service (Formspree, Netlify Forms) or your email.
- Instagram and Pinterest links in the footer: now the networks' home pages; owner's target: your profile addresses.
- Newsletter link in the footer: now mailto: placeholder; owner's target: your newsletter sign-up page.
- The form in `#maker` (fields `frame`, `core`, `inlay`, `size`) is the tile designer: it has no submit button and sends nothing; `section-script:maker` only updates the preview, the summary and the price on every change and blocks a submit. To take orders, pass the chosen values to your shop or an order form (for example as a query string on the Put it in a sample box link), or keep it as a preview only.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `email`, `project`, `area`, `message`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Inset (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (10, Unsplash: opening 1, making 2, projects 6, samples 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for
All demo text, never to be invented:

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the menu button cannot open the overlay (on wide screens the nav links are visible), the designer keeps its default summary and price whatever is picked, and the patterns and making sections show their plain layouts.
- The form and the designer send nothing: the contact form posts to the same page and the designer form only changes the preview. Connect a form service or a shop before publishing.
- The patterns and making sections hold the screen for 310svh and 420svh; on short or landscape phone screens the stage is tight.
- The opening field is made of about two hundred small elements and sorts them with a script on every refresh; on slow phones the first scroll can feel heavier than the rest of the page.
- The decorative tile chips in the projects collage are hidden from screen readers; the captions carry the project facts.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Inset left only in class names.
