# AGENTS.md: perfumery website template

One-page website for an independent perfumery that sells by appointment and by post. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:nav`: `.nav-toggle` `.nav-close`
  - `scene:opening`: `.op-line` `.op-strip` `.op-strips` `.op-dome` `.op-copy` `.op-card--l` `.op-card--r` `.op-arch` `.op-act`
  - `section-script:visit`: `.vs-form` `.vs-status` `data-sent` `data-error`
  - `scene:origins`: `.or-track` `.or-stage` `.or-grid` `.or-tile--c` `.or-photo` `.or-tile`
  - `scene:cabinet`: `.cb-track` `.cb-title` `.cb-word` `.cb-deck` `.cb-card`
  - `scene:accord`: `.ac-frame` `.ac-half` `.ac-gap`
  - `scene:noses`: `.ns-word` `.ns-person` `.ns-arch`
  - `scene:blind-set`: `.bs-visual` `.bs-photo` `.bs-slots`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Noses` is 5.
- The origins grid has six tiles placed by named CSS classes (tile a to f, one grid area each, two layouts for desktop and phone) and the scene starts the tile with the class or-tile--c (the rose, in the middle column) full screen. Add or remove tiles only together with their grid areas.
- The cabinet scene reads a list of four tilts for the cards; a fifth card would need a fifth value in that list and a longer scroll track.
- The six round openings of the sample set are placed by nth-child rules on the labels (one set for desktop, one for phone) and the scene opens them with the custom property --bs-r; keep six labels, or add rules for more.
- The drawn thread lines are SVG paths of pathLength 1, drawn by the stroke-dashoffset tween with autoRound off; keep that flag if you edit the tween, or the line pops instead of drawing.
- The big word "Noses" is sized from style="--len:5", the number of characters; change it with the word.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #141213 (near-black: page ground, nav bar once it turns solid, opening second screen, origins, noses and footer grounds, and the text colour on cream and white sections), `--color-2` #f1eade (warm cream: type on the dark sections, ground of shelf, accord, resting, questions and visit, the four tasting strips, the numbered vial discs and the hover fill of dark buttons), `--color-3` #573726 (dark brown: top of the first screen's gradient, ground of the sample set section and backing of the portrait arches), `--color-4` #8c5f43 (mid brown: lower end of the first screen's gradient), `--color-5` #ffffff (white: ground of the cabinet section, the footer card, white buttons and the menu button, the disc behind the number on the shelf, and the thread line on the visit section), `--color-6` #675a50 (muted brown-grey: small print, batch numbers, notes labels, FAQ answers and form placeholders on the light sections), `--color-7` #a99d91 (muted warm grey: secondary text on the dark sections, such as the origin places, the second heading half and the portrait bios), `--color-8` #b48a5a (amber: the thread lines on the cream sections and footer card, and the ring around the number of scents on the shelf); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, email, form, phone): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Book a session link in the header: now #visit; owner's target: your booking page URL if you take bookings elsewhere, or keep it on the request form.
- Book a blind session button in the first screen: now #visit; owner's target: your booking page URL, or keep it on the request form.
- How a blind session works link in the second screen: now #questions; owner's target: keep it, or point it to a page that explains your tasting.
- See if a seat is free button in the shelf section: now #visit; owner's target: your availability or booking page, or keep it on the request form.
- Smell all four at home first: the Blind Set link under the cabinet: now #blind-set; owner's target: keep it, or point it to your sample set product page.
- Order the Blind Set button: now a mailto: link with the subject "The Blind Set"; owner's target: your shop or checkout link for the sample set.
- Send request button of the booking form: now a script checks name, email and the consent box and shows a thank-you line; nothing is sent (the form has action="#visit"); owner's target: a form service (Formspree, Netlify Forms) or your booking system, or remove the form and keep the email and phone.
- The form in `#visit` (fields `name`, `email`, `day`, `notes`, `consent`) sends nothing; `section-script:visit` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name The Resin Cabinet (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (24, Unsplash: opening 3, origins 6, shelf 1, cabinet 4, accord 2, resting 3, noses 3, blind-set 1, visit 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for
All demo text, never to be invented:
- Perfumer and team: Ines Marlow trained in Grasse, Callum Reid, Sara Okafor, and their biographical lines (noses).

- Material origins and seasons: six materials with places and months (origins). They are specific to this brand; replace them with your own sourcing.
- Session terms: "Fifty minutes at the table", "a dozen strips", "A session costs £25, taken off any bottle you buy", Thursday to Saturday 11:00 to 18:00 by appointment (questions, visit).
- Sample set: six vials of 2 ml, £38 credited against the first full bottle (blind set, questions).

- Shipping and returns: "Within the UK and the EU", packed "by hand on Mondays", "Unopened bottles within 30 days", swap opened ones for samples (questions).

- Training and claims: "Trained in Grasse", "turns down most briefs", "None of them sells on commission" (noses).

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the menu button cannot open the menu, so below 860 px, where the header links are hidden, only the footer links remain; the booking form has no sending code.
- The origins and cabinet sections sit in tall scroll tracks with held stages, so on short screens the photos and cards are cramped.
- The two small notes beside the heading are 13 px cream text over the brown gradient and photos; check their contrast again when you change the photos or colours.
- The scenes move large parts (the ink dome, the origins stage, the dealt deck), which can feel heavy on slow phones.
- gsap, ScrollTrigger, SplitText and Lenis load from jsDelivr at the end of the body without defer; if the CDN fails, the scroll scenes and smooth scrolling are missing but every section still shows.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and The Resin Cabinet left only in class names.
