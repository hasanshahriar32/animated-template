# AGENTS.md: saas landing page template

One-page website for a SaaS or app that sends small businesses one short weekly message, with a phone mockup, two plans and a contact form. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:navigation`: `.nav__toggle` `.nav__overlay` `.nav__close`
  - `scene:noise`: `.noise__stage` `.noise__head` `.noise__field` `.noise__note`
  - `scene:sources`: `.sources__col` `.sources__cols` `data-sources-key` `.sources__body`
  - `scene:note`: `.note__panel` `.note__phone` `data-sources-key` `.note__part` `.note__block` `data-part` `data-on`
  - `scene:makers`: `.makers__stage` `.makers__track`
  - `scene:field`: `.field__stage` `.field__grid` `data-field-zoom`
  - `scene:manifesto`: `.manifesto__line` `.manifesto__strike`
  - `scene:pricing`: `.pricing__plan` `.pricing__plans`
  - `scene:contact`: `.contact__half` `.contact__email`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.contact__form` `.contact__done` `.contact__error`
- `sources` directly above `note`: the animation crosses that border and stops if they are split.
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `No dashboards.` is 14, `No streaks.` is 11, `No charts at midnight.` is 22, `One sentence on Monday.` is 23.
- The wordmark is six pieces of drawn SVG stroke paths (top bar, menu overlay, phone, two surface tiles, footer), not text in a font. Changing the name needs new paths in each of them and in the footer's glyph paths (the footer animation reads six glyph paths).
- The four manifesto lines and the contact address carry style="--len:N", their character count, which sets the font size so they fit the width. Update it when the text changes.
- The sources section has exactly five columns and the field grid exactly eight tiles; the unfolding strip and the zoom are built for those counts. The Messages column carries data-sources-key, which the next section's panel starts from.
- The phone mockup, tiles, chips and arches are HTML and CSS, not images: recolour them through the colour variables in :root.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #6e1c1a (maroon: page ground, buttons, the note panel behind the phone, manifesto and contact backgrounds, the first-screen note card), `--color-2` #fee7a6 (butter: first screen, moodboard and FAQ backgrounds, text on dark slabs, the signal chips, form fields), `--color-3` #3d2217 (dark brown: body text, the Stock column, makers, surfaces and footer backgrounds, the hover fill of maroon buttons, borders), `--color-4` #8c4f25 (rust: the Visits column, one moodboard note, the printed-card tile), `--color-5` #bb9657 (gold: the Sales column, one moodboard note, the text-message tile, the hover fill of butter buttons and FAQ rows, the active outline on the phone), `--color-6` #171616 (near-black: sources and pricing backgrounds, the phone body); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, email, phone, form): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Start free button in the top bar and the phone menu, Start listening button in the first screen: now #pricing; owner's target: your sign-up or trial page.
- Read a Monday note link in the first screen: now #note; owner's target: keep it, or link to a sample note or a demo.
- Start four free weeks buttons in the two plans (Studio, Collective): now #contact; owner's target: your checkout or sign-up page for each plan.
- Email links in the questions and in the large address in the contact section: now a mailto link to the placeholder address hello@murmur.example; owner's target: your support address.
- Phone link in the contact section: now a tel link to a placeholder number; owner's target: your phone number, or delete the line.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `email`, `shop`, `message`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` validates it and shows the thank-you text. Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name murmur (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (11, Unsplash: makers 5, field 5, faq 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for
All demo text, never to be invented:
- Prices: Studio €9 a month, Collective €24 a month, "Prices include VAT", billing terms and "Four Mondays free", "No card needed until your fifth note" (pricing, FAQ).
- Customer count and customers: "forty-one small studios" and the five named makers with trades, towns and quotes (makers, field notes).
- What the product connects to and does: five sources, read-only access, "under twenty" words per sentence, "The common online shop platforms and card readers" (sources, note, FAQ).
- Delivery: Monday at 7:40, by app, email or text, a Thursday check-in, a printed card posted weekly (note, surfaces, pricing).
- Privacy promises: no ads, no data sold, stored in the EU, deleted the day an account closes, no notifications after six (manifesto, FAQ).
- Pause and cancel terms: pause up to eight weeks without billing, cancel in two taps (FAQ, pricing).
- Plan limits: one shop, up to five shops, up to eight people, replies from a person within a day (pricing, FAQ, contact).
- Sample signals and figures: 41 shop visits, 3 returns, a green vase saved 12 times, card fees up 0.2%, a postage change in May, and the other chips (first screen, sources).
- Company: "murmur AB, Stockholm", the Stockholm studio address, phone, email and hours Monday to Thursday 9:00 to 16:00 are placeholders (contact, footer, FAQ).
- Languages and time zones: "Notes arrive in your language and your time zone" (note).
- The note's date "Monday, 13 October" and "Week 42" (note, surfaces).
- "Posted weekly on Collective" and the Collective plan features (surfaces, pricing).

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the Menu button cannot open the overlay, and the top bar links are hidden under 960 px.
- On phones the "Heard this week" lines in the five sources columns are hidden to fit the screen.
- The contact form has no backend: it checks the name and email, shows the thank-you line and sends nothing until you connect a form service.
- The first screen, the sources, the makers and the moodboard pin the page (300svh, 290svh, a long horizontal track and a zoom), which feels long on short laptop screens; with reduced motion they become plain stacked sections.
- Five Unsplash portraits and five moodboard photos load from Unsplash's servers, and the maker names on them are invented.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and murmur left only in class names.
