# AGENTS.md: planetarium website template

One-page website for a planetarium or observatory with a live-narrated show programme. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:navigation`: `.nav__toggle` `.nav__overlay` `.nav__close`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.ct__form` `.ct__status`
  - `scene:journey`: `.jr__pin` `.jr__track` `.jr__line` `.jr__runner` `.jr__stop` `.jr__img`
  - `scene:dome`: `.dm__sky` `.dm__turn` `.dm__ring`
  - `scene:live`: `.lv__photo` `.lv__words`
  - `scene:roof`: `.rf__photo` `.rf__half--l` `.rf__panel--l` `.rf__half--r` `.rf__panel--r`
  - `scene:nights`: `.nt__rail` `.nt__line` `.nt__event`
  - `scene:contact`: `.ct__night` `.ct__ring`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Zenith` is 6.
- The wordmark in the footer sets its size from style="--len:6", the number of characters of the name. Change it with the name.
- The colour bands of the show rows come from classes sh__band--1 to sh__band--5, so a sixth show needs its own band rule. The time buttons sit in a group labelled for screen readers.
- The dome section's height and sticky stage are set by CSS added with the scene; the heading parts and two paragraphs are placed on a twelve-column grid by name (dm__w1 to dm__w3, dm__p1, dm__p2).
- The opening ring, rays, night and sky layers are empty divs drawn with CSS gradients and borders: recolour them through the CSS variables.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #eb5d16 (flat orange ground of the shows section and the footer, and the warm end of the contact gradient), `--color-2` #140a31 (main night ground: body, first screen, journey, nights, the logo's pill once you scroll and the start of the live and contact gradients), `--color-3` #4c27b8 (blue-violet ground of the dome and schools sections and of the full-screen phone menu), `--color-4` #ee55b6 (magenta: the roof's right panel, the journey runner, the event dots, text selection and the glow in the live and contact gradients), `--color-5` #ffffff (type on dark grounds, the white nav pill, filled buttons, the question section ground and the stars), `--color-6` #0f0822 (type on orange, white and magenta grounds, button text, dark buttons and the rules in the shows list and questions), `--color-7` #ffc9ee (pale pink for captions, stop distances, event dates and meta lines, contact labels and the thank-you line), `--color-8` #a3300c (rust: the roof's left panel and the colour bands of the first and fifth shows); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, phone, email, form, social): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Book seats button in the header: now #shows; owner's target: your online ticket shop, or keep it on the programme.
- See tonight’s shows button in the first screen: now #shows; owner's target: your ticketing or programme page, or keep it on the programme.
- The ten time buttons in the shows list (12:00, 16:30, 20:30 and so on): now #contact; owner's target: the booking page for that show and time on your ticket system.
- Plan a class visit button in the schools section: now #contact; owner's target: your school booking form or an email link.
- Send to the box office button of the contact form: now action="#" with method post; a script checks the fields, clears the form and shows the thank-you line, nothing is sent; owner's target: your form endpoint (Formspree, Netlify Forms) or your own handler; drop the preventDefault in section-script:contact when you do.
- Monthly sky notes and Private hire links in the footer: now mailto links with a subject; owner's target: your newsletter sign-up page and private hire page, or keep the mailto.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `email`, `message`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Zenith Planetarium (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (13, Unsplash: journey 5, dome 1, live 1, roof 1, schools 1, nights 4): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for

- Photos: the presenter portrait and the audience images are stock photos shown as the venue’s people and events (live, nights).

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the Menu button cannot open the overlay on phones; the footer links stay reachable. The questions are native details and open without it.
- The contact form is a demo: with JavaScript it only clears itself and shows the thank-you line; without it the form posts to #.
- The journey section is pinned for the width the five stops overflow, which is long on wide screens, and the dome holds for about 1.3 screens.
- Small pale pink text (stop distances, school prices, event dates and meta lines, contact labels) sits on night and violet grounds; check its contrast after changing colours.
- gsap, ScrollTrigger and Lenis load from a CDN before the motion scripts; offline they are missing and the motion does not run.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Zenith Planetarium left only in class names.
