# AGENTS.md: bowling alley website template

One-page website for a bowling alley or entertainment venue with leagues, a kitchen and bar, glow nights and party bookings. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:nav`: `.nv-bar` `.nv-menu` `.nv-close`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.ct-form` `.ct-status`
  - `scene:leagues`: `.lg-cards` `.lg-wash`
  - `scene:kitchen`: `.kt-photo` `.kt-group`
  - `scene:fame`: `.fm-list` `.fm-row` `data-day`
  - `scene:parties`: `.pt-track`
  - `scene:faq`: `.fq-panel` `.fq-ball--a` `.fq-ball--b`
  - `scene:footer`: `.ft-word`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Pinfall` is 7.
- The footer wordmark is split into one span per letter by the footer scene, which reads the text of .ft-word at run time, so change the word in the HTML and the letters follow; its style="--len:7" is the character count and sizes it to fill the width.
- The leaderboard scene reads each row's data-day to work out the order the games were bowled, then slides the rows into the printed rank order; give every row its own data-day from 1 to 7.
- The kitchen scene pairs photo n with menu group n (photo 1 shows from the start, photos 2 to 4 roll in as groups 2 to 4 arrive) and skips any photo without a group; keep as many .kt-photo images as .kt-group blocks. The last photo in the HTML sits on top when the scene does not run.
- The glow section is driven by one custom property, --gl-night, and every colour in it derives from it; the balls, stamp, icons, brush scribbles (SVG filter #brush, paths with pathLength 1), the dashed ring round the dish photos and the colour washes are CSS and SVG, not images: recolour them through the variables in :root and keep the filter and pathLength.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #15130c (page ground, header bar, default button fill, text on the yellow and sky-blue panels, and the black the glow section dims to), `--color-2` #ffd23f (menu and questions panels, contact form, top leaderboard row, yellow buttons, footer wordmark and links, the two balls, focus rings), `--color-3` #c8381f (the red sweep that fills buttons on hover, the Book now stamp, the Bar tile word), `--color-4` #fffdf5 (cream text on the dark ground, the league pills and the text of the party price pills, the stamp label), `--color-5` #b9a2f5 (Lanes tile word, Office socials panel, Call tile, the glow heading at night), `--color-6` #8ccbe6 (beginners' hour panel and the Lane takeover party panel), `--color-7` #f28a2e (Kitchen tile word, Kids' parties panel, Email tile, the warm edge of the balls), `--color-8` #8a55e0 (purple colour band over the first portrait and one of the two glow pools), `--color-9` #23a26b (green colour band over the second portrait), `--color-10` #3d7be0 (blue colour band over the third portrait and the second glow pool), `--color-11` #211e15 (surfaces of the three tiles, the leaderboard and the footer panel), `--color-12` #3d3828 (hairline borders of the tiles and the leaderboard); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, email, phone, form): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Book a lane button in the top bar and the opening, and the Book a lane link in the menu overlay: now #contact (the contact section and form); owner's target: your online lane booking URL, or keep it on the contact form.
- Gift cards button in the top bar: now #contact; owner's target: your gift card shop URL.
- Join a league button in the leagues section: now #contact; owner's target: your league sign-up page, or keep it on the form.
- Plan a party button in the parties section: now #contact; owner's target: your party enquiry or booking page.
- Book a glow lane button in the glow section: now #contact; owner's target: your booking page for Friday glow lanes.
- Book rookie hour button in the beginners' section: now #contact; owner's target: your booking page for the beginners' hour, or keep it on the form.
- The Book now stamp in the footer: now #contact; owner's target: your booking URL.
- Menu items (the lane-side kitchen): now text only, no links; owner's target: your menu PDF or ordering page, if you want to link one.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `email`, `date`, `group`, `message`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Pinfall Lanes (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (14, Unsplash: leagues 3, menu 4, glow 1, parties 4, lessons 1, contact 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for
All demo text, never to be invented:

- Glow Fridays: 9pm to 1am, DJ Kwame, over-18s (glow, FAQ, footer).
- Leaderboard: six names, scores, lanes and days, "Bowl a perfect 300 and your name goes up for good, with a free lane on every birthday after" (leaderboard).

- Footer: "© 2026 Pinfall Lanes"; put in your legal name.

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the burger button cannot open the overlay, the footer wordmark stays whole, and the contact form still requires a name and email but then reloads the page with no thank-you line.
- The four dish photos are stacked in one disc, so with reduced motion or without JavaScript only the cocktail shows and the burger, fries and shake are never seen; the top bar still hides on scroll down with reduced motion.
- The contact form is a demo and sends nothing; connect it to Formspree, Netlify Forms or your own endpoint.
- The parties section holds the screen for as far as its row of panels overflows the screen width, which feels long on a phone.
- The opening hours in the tiles and in the contact section do not agree (kitchen until 11pm every day against Sunday closing at 10pm); make them match your times.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Pinfall Lanes left only in class names.
