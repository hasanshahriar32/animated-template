# AGENTS.md: tile store website template

One-page website for a tile shop or bathroom studio with a showroom, free samples and its own fitters. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:navigation`: `.nav__menu` `.nav__list`
  - `section-script:samples`: `.sp__form` `.sp__msg` `data-limit` `data-missing` `data-sent`
  - `scene:bonds`: `.bd__row` `.bd__name` `.bd__track`
  - `scene:rooms`: `.rm__room` `.rm__item` `.rm__marker` `.rm__track`
  - `scene:glazes`: `.gz__stage` `.gz__rail` `.gz__bay` `.gz__field` `.fill`
  - `scene:service`: `.sv__marker` `.sv__step` `.sv__steps`
  - `scene:contact`: `.ct__photo` `.ct__red` `.fill` `.ct__yellow`
- The blue, yellow and red fields, the ruled cells and the bond wall are CSS, not images: recolour them through the colour variables in :root (yellow is --color-3, blue --color-4, red --color-5).
- The bond wall has four rows of seven cells, and the scene reads the first cell's width and the gap to set how far each row slides; keep seven cells of equal size in every row (five show at once on a wide screen), so a shifted row never opens a gap at the right.
- The four room photos are stacked layers clipped by the rooms scene: keep exactly four photos, one per caption, in the same order as the list.
- The glazes row is measured by the script, so the scroll length follows the number of bays; a new bay needs its own .gz__bay--<name> rule for its field colour, and the photo and colour field of each bay sit in its own .gz__top.
- The sample form text lives in data-limit, data-missing and data-sent on the status line: change the sentences there and keep {name} and {count}.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #ffffff (page ground and the fill of every cell between the rules, button text on black, text of checked sample chips and lit step numbers), `--color-2` #121212 (text, the rules between cells, primary buttons, checked sample chips, lit step numbers, the black wall cell and the Ink glaze field), `--color-3` #ffcf00 (yellow: the blocks in the navigation bar, opening and contact, button hover wipe, current-section underline, active bond and room markers, the current step, guarantee and phone cards, the Saffron glaze), `--color-4` #1858b8 (blue: the block in the opening and the strip beside the samples form, the moving step marker, focus outlines on buttons and fields, the Cobalt glaze), `--color-5` #e1251b (red: end of the navigation bar, blocks in the opening, materials, contact and footer, the Signal glaze and wall cells), `--color-6` #d9d9d9 (grey: the table header row, the Chalk glaze field, one wall cell and the ground behind the glaze photos), `--color-7` #5c5c5c (captions and descriptions in small text, and the No cells in the materials table); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, form, phone, map, email, social): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Free sample button in the opening: now #samples (the sample form); owner's target: your sample request page, or keep it on the form.
- Visit the showroom link in the opening: now #contact; owner's target: keep it on the contact section, or your appointment booking page.
- Sample box icon in the top bar: now #samples; owner's target: your samples or catalogue page.
- Basket icon in the top bar: now #opening, with a count of 0 that nothing updates; owner's target: your shop basket, or remove the icon if you do not sell online.
- Directions link in the contact section: now a Google Maps search for the city only; owner's target: the map URL of your showroom.
- How a job runs link in the fitters section: now #service; owner's target: keep it, or your fitting page.
- The form in `#samples` (fields `sample`, `name`, `email`, `postcode`) sends nothing; `section-script:samples` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name TEGEL (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (26, Unsplash: opening 1, bonds 5, materials 6, rooms 4, samples 1, glazes 5, fitters 3, contact 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the menu button cannot open the link list on phones, the sample form does not run its checks, and the basket count stays 0.
- The sample form is a demo and sends nothing; connect it to Formspree, Netlify Forms or your own endpoint.
- The basket icon is decoration: it goes to the top of the page and its count is never updated.
- The opening hours line says Monday to Saturday 9 to 5:30 while the contact section lists Saturday until 16:00; make them agree.
- The top bar hides while you scroll down and returns on scroll up, also with reduced motion on.
- The bonds (two screens of scrolling), rooms (three screens) and glazes (about one screen on a laptop) sections hold the screen for long stretches of scrolling, which feels long on a phone.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and TEGEL left only in class names.
