# AGENTS.md: stationery shop website template

One-page website for a stationery shop or paper studio, for customers who browse, join a subscription and book workshops. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:navigation`: `.nav__menu` `.menu` `.menu__close`
  - `section-script:paper`: `.pa-tab` `.pa-detail` `.pa-stack`
  - `section-script:visit`: `.vi-form` `.vi-status`
  - `scene:shelves`: `.sh-row` `.sh-shot`
  - `scene:arrivals`: `.ar-card`
  - `scene:press`: `.pr-stage` `.pr-row` `.pr-step` `.pr-shot`
  - `scene:club`: `.cl-tiers` `.cl-tier`
  - `scene:evenings`: `.ev-cards` `.ev-card`
  - `scene:visit`: `.vi-mark` `.vi-address` `.vi-line`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `27 Ash Row,` is 11, `Edinburgh.` is 10, `Quire` is 5.
- The address heading in the visit section is two spans with style="--len:N" (11 and 10 characters), and the footer wordmark has style="--len:5": update the numbers when the text changes.
- The paper library tabs and panels are linked by ids (pa-tab-1 to pa-panel-1, and so on) and by order to the four photos in the stack; keep the four in step when adding or removing a paper.
- The visit scene builds the lilac twin by copying the heading with a script, so any change to the heading is copied too; do not add a second copy by hand.
- The shelves section pairs the five rows with the five photos by position: keep the same count in both lists.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #ffffff (page background, text on the ink panels and on hovered buttons, the selected paper tab), `--color-2` #151515 (text, the ink panels (paper library, subscription, footer), button fill on hover, the Desk button), `--color-3` #6b6b6b (secondary text: leads, notes, makers' places, answers, shelf titles before they become current), `--color-4` #f3f3f3 (grey surfaces: nav pill, paper tab list, evening cards, enquiry form, alternate maker tiles, printing step cards, question icons), `--color-5` #d7a6e5 (the only accent: opening panel, button fills, the Most chosen mark, the Desk tier, the thank-you line, the address copy, focus rings on ink panels), `--color-6` #242424 (tier cards inside the subscription panel and the paper photo frame), `--color-7` #e2e2e2 (hairlines above shelf rows, card footers, question rows and maker tile borders), `--color-8` #a8a8a8 (muted text on the ink panels: leads, spec labels, tier descriptions, footer labels); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, phone, email, form): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Visit the shop button in the nav: now #visit; owner's target: keep, or your shop or directions page.
- See the shelves button and the Thursday evenings at the shop link in the opening: now #shelves and #evenings; owner's target: keep, or your online shop and your events page.
- Ask us to hold one button in New on the shelves: now #visit, the contact form; owner's target: your product or reservation page.
- Start a print order button in the printing section: now #visit; owner's target: your print order form or page.
- Choose Pocket, Choose Desk and Choose Studio buttons in the club section: now #visit; owner's target: your subscription checkout links, one per tier.
- Book a place links on the three evening cards: now #visit; owner's target: your booking or ticket page for each workshop.
- Phone and email links in the questions, visit and footer sections: now a tel: link and a mailto: link with placeholder numbers; owner's target: your real phone number and email address.
- The form in `#visit` (fields `name`, `email`, `topic`, `message`) sends nothing; `section-script:visit` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Quire (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (22, Unsplash: opening 1, shelves 5, paper 4, arrivals 4, press 4, evenings 3, visit 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the menu button does nothing and all four paper panels show under the tabs; the FAQ rows open natively. The enquiry form is a placeholder either way: it sends nothing (with JavaScript it resets and shows a thank-you line) until you connect a form service.
- With reduced motion or without JavaScript the shelves plate shows only its last photo (Paint & drawing) whichever row is in view, and the shelf titles stay grey: the photo swap is part of the scroll scene.
- The workshop cards show fixed dates in October 2026, already past; the arrival dates are fixed text too.
- In the press scene the pinned row is a horizontal slide on all screen sizes, which feels long on a phone because the row is wide.
- Light grey text on white and the lilac accent on pale panels should be checked for contrast after any recolouring.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Quire left only in class names.
