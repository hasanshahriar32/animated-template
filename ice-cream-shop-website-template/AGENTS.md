# AGENTS.md: ice cream shop website template

One-page website for an ice cream parlour, gelateria or dessert shop with flavours, prices, workshops and a monthly subscription. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:navigation`: `.nav__menu` `.nav__overlay` `.nav__close`
  - `scene:deck`: `.flavours__track` `.flavour`
  - `scene:peel`: `.q` `.q__card` `.q__phrase` `.q__answer`
  - `scene:bump`: `.neighbours__side--l` `.neighbours__move` `.neighbours__side--r` `.neighbours__meet`
  - `scene:fan`: `.plan` `.club__plans`
  - `scene:cross`: `.reviews__band` `.reviews__track` `.reviews__bands`
  - `section-script:visit`: `.visit__form` `.visit__status` `data-sent`
  - `scene:melt`: `.footer__mark`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `melty.` is 6.
- The footer wordmark gets its size from style="--len:6", the number of characters in melty. including the period: update it when the name changes. A scene splits the wordmark into letters.
- The flavour deck, the question peel and the review ribbons read their items from the page, so the counts can change; the Pint Club grid has three columns (one on phones), the fan script measures the cards where the grid puts them, and the CSS keeps the second card on top.
- The stickers, the ink outlines, hard shadows and highlight boxes are CSS: recolour them through the colour variables in :root.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #fff48d (lemon page ground, the first screen, the logo pill, plan price pills, the end of the visit gradient), `--color-2` #1d1c1c (text, every 1.5px outline, the hard shadows (except under the dark button) and the dark button), `--color-3` #ffffff (white cards, nav bar, buttons, form fields, badges and the first review ribbon), `--color-4` #fd74fd (pink: button hover wipe, second highlight style, second question card, second review ribbon, shadow of the dark button), `--color-5` #83f582 (green: first highlight style, first question card, odd price pills, nav link hover, ribbon dots, gradient), `--color-6` #7af7f7 (cyan: third highlight style, third question card, even price pills, gradient), `--color-7` #ff6a8d (coral: start of the menu overlay and visit section gradients), `--color-8` #ffb38a (peach: middle of those gradients and start of the flavour card gradient), `--color-9` #b06cf8 (violet: end of the Pint Club sheet gradient and of the green card gradient); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, phone, email, form, social): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Order a pint button in the nav: now #club; owner's target: your online ordering page, or keep #club for the Pint Club.
- Join solo, Join as a duo and Fill my freezer buttons in the Pint Club: now #visit; owner's target: the sign-up or checkout page for each plan.
- Book a Saturday button in the churn school: now #visit; owner's target: your workshop booking page.
- Cups, cones and pints link in the flavours section, and the birthday booking link in the questions: now #prices and #visit; owner's target: keep them, or point the birthday link at your booking page.
- Instagram and TikTok icons and the email icon in the footer: now the Instagram and TikTok home pages, and a mailto link; owner's target: your own profiles and email.
- The form in `#visit` (fields `name`, `email`, `topic`, `date`, `guests`, `note`) sends nothing; `section-script:visit` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Melty (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (18, Unsplash: opening 1, flavours 5, morning 3, questions 3, prices 1, neighbours 2, school 1, club 1, visit 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for
All demo text, never to be invented:
- Shop profile: a twelve-seat small-batch ice cream parlour with a brand line, "Open daily from noon", twelve flavours a day, a flavour gone when its tub is empty, "Melty Ice Cream Ltd" (title, meta description, opening, footer).
- Flavours: names, descriptions, ingredient sources and tags (dairy-free, nuts, gluten, "every week", "new this week") for five flavours, and "five of them new this week" (flavours).
- Production claims: shopping at the market at six, twelve runs of six litres before eleven, two hours resting at minus fourteen (morning).
- Allergen and diet claims: "at least four" dairy-free flavours, sorbets of fruit, sugar and water only, an oat-milk chocolate churned separately on Tuesdays and Fridays (questions).
- Takeaway claims: pints kept firm for forty minutes in a lined bag, free dry ice at the till (questions).
- Party terms: up to twenty guests on weekday afternoons, a tasting flight of six, book a week ahead (questions).
- Prices: £3.20, £5.40, £7.20, £9.50 and £17 rows, toppings at 80p, free tasting spoons (prices).
- Suppliers: eight named local producers and what each provides (neighbours); all invented.
- Workshop: Saturdays 9 to 11, six people aged eight and up, £45 with a pint included (school, visit).
- Pint Club: Solo £11, Duo £20, Freezer full £36 a month, collection or cycle delivery, skip any month (club).
- Reviews: eight invented quotes and names (reviews).
- Address, hours (12:00 to 21:00 Monday to Thursday, to 22:00 Friday and Saturday, to 20:00 Sunday), the walk from the station, twelve seats, a bench and a hatch, the placeholder phone 020 0000 0000 and email hello@melty.example (visit, footer, overlay).
- Booking promise: "We’ll write back within a day" (visit form).

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the phone menu button cannot open the overlay and the booking form posts back to the page itself and sends nothing; the flavours show as a tilted column and the reviews as wrapped rows.
- The page loads GSAP's SplitText plugin for the heading fill and the footer wordmark, so it needs the extra script from the CDN.
- The flavour deck pins the page for about three screens, which can feel long on short phone screens.
- With motion allowed the review bands scroll sideways on their own (paused on hover, focus and when off screen). With reduced motion they stay as wrapped rows, but the bottom bar still hides on scroll and hover effects keep running.
- The questions are headings and answers in cards, not native details elements, so they are always open.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Melty left only in class names.
