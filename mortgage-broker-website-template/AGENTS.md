# AGENTS.md: mortgage broker website template

One-page website for a mortgage broker or adviser who compares the whole market and books free calls. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:navigation`: `.nav__menu` `.menu__close`
  - `section-script:market`: `.market__field` `.market__lines` `.market__count` `.market__chart` `data-bank`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.contact__form` `.contact__status`
  - `scene:market`: `.market__field` `.market__line`
  - `scene:method`: `.method__step` `.method__photo` `.method__dot` `.method__shift`
  - `scene:advisers`: `.adviser` `.adviser__frame` `.adviser__text`
  - `scene:switch`: `.switch__track` `.switch__fill` `.switch__dot`
  - `scene:offer`: `.offer__frame` `.offer__img` `.offer__panel` `.offer__chart`
  - `scene:contact`: `.contact__visual` `.contact__disc` `.contact__photo`
- The market chart counts its lines from the value of the data element in the lead paragraph (94; the script then sets --market-count, whose inline value draws the plain stripes shown before the script runs). The bank's dark line is the position in data-bank (31) on the field, and the label follows the inline --market-bank on the chart: keep the two equal and below the count. The 94 also appears as text in the opening card, the method step and chip, the ledger and the offer checks: change them all together.
- The method scene reads one photo and one index dot for every step, so keep four steps with four photos and four dots, or add all three together.
- The switch section turns into a strip of panels only while the scene runs: it sets the section to one screen high with a flex strip; each new panel needs a dot with the class switch__dot, which the scene scales.
- The line chart in the offer panel draws with strokeDashoffset from 1 to 0 and autoRound turned off so it draws smoothly; keep that setting if you restyle it.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #ffffff (page ground, the nav bar, the footer card and the call-back form card, text on the dark sections), `--color-2` #18181b (body text, the dark buttons, the advisers section ground, the bank's line in the chart, the switch dots and fill line), `--color-3` #62626b (secondary small text and the descriptions in the fee ledger), `--color-4` #f4f4f5 (alternate ledger rows, the FAQ section ground, the form fields), `--color-5` #ffb547 (amber: the middle of the glow gradient, the switch section's final ground, adviser specialities, the method index dots, the line in the offer panel's chart), `--color-6` #fc5f2b (ember: the chart lines other than the bank's, bullets and step markers, the round badge icon behind the white tick, the link underline on hover, the end of the glow), `--color-7` #120d0a (warm near black: the contact section and footer ground, the backing of the photo frames, the dark photo chips and the offer panel), `--color-8` #a1a1aa (muted small text, such as the one-line adviser notes and the photo chip subtitles), `--color-9` #e4e4e7 (hairlines, field borders, the pale start of the chart lines and the dimmed ledger and FAQ rows before they light up), `--color-10` #ffe3b3 (the cream centre of every glow: the first screen, the button hover, the logo mark and the contact disc); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, phone, email, form): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Book a free call buttons (header, menu, first screen, included, offer and footer): now #contact; owner's target: your booking calendar URL (Calendly, Cal.com) if you take bookings there, or keep them on the call-back form.
- Call link in the header, menu, FAQ, contact block and footer: now a tel: link to the office phone; owner's target: your own number.
- Request a call button of the call-back form: now action="#contact" with method post; a script checks required fields, clears the form and shows a thank-you line, nothing is sent; owner's target: your form endpoint (Formspree, Netlify Forms) or your own handler; replace section-script:contact when you do, since it resets the fields inside the submit handler and a plain post without its preventDefault would send them empty.
- Privacy and Complaints links in the footer legal line: now /privacy and /complaints on your own domain, which do not exist yet; owner's target: your privacy notice and complaints procedure pages.
- See how it works link in the first screen: now #method; owner's target: keep it.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `phone`, `email`, `plan`, `time`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Keylight Mortgages (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (13, Unsplash: method 4, advisers 4, stories 3, offer 1, contact 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for
All demo text, never to be invented:
- Fee model: "Brokers can charge up to £995. Our fee is £0", the lender-paid fee of 0.35% to 0.45% of the loan, and a £495 fee for complex cases (included, offer, FAQ).
- Regulation: "authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority", the repossession warning and the buy-to-let note (footer): the wording must be true for your firm and no firm reference number is on the page.
- Market claims: 94 lenders, 41 of 94 who would say yes, 3 deals out of 94 (opening, market, method, included, offer); the chart count also sits in a data element and inline variables.
- Example figures: borrowing up to £312,500, deposit £35,000 at 10%, a 30 year term, £1,486 a month at 4.29% fixed, valid until 14 January 2027, a couple earning £68,000 (opening card); £1,286 against £1,412 a month (offer); 4.29% and 3.94% fixed rates, a fix ending 31 March 2031, 7.49% standard variable (switch); a valuation on Thursday 10:30 and keys released at 12:04 (method chips).
- Service promises: a 20-minute call, a written figure within a day, an agreement in principle the same week, a soft search with no footprint, a call six months before a deal ends, offers in two to four weeks (opening, included, FAQ).
- Hours: calls from 8am to 8pm on weekdays and 10 to 4 on Saturdays (included, offer, contact).
- People: Hannah Moorcroft, Daniel Okafor, Raj Mistry and Ellie Varga, their specialities, 900 first-time buyers, twenty-two years and "61 years" between them; the portraits are stock photos (advisers).
- Client stories: Amira and Tom of Chapel Allerton, Jess of Kirkstall and Mei of Roundhay, the £38,000 and £212 a month results and their quotes (stories).
- Reviews: "Rated 4.9 out of 5 across 1,240 reviews" (stories).
- Advice claims in the FAQ: deposit levels of 5%, 10% and 15%, two years of accounts for the self-employed (FAQ): check them against your lender panel.
- Address, phone and email placeholders in the contact block, footer and FAQ; the city name Leeds in the tagline and contact: put in your own.
- Legal line: "Keylight Mortgages Ltd" with the copyright in the footer: put in your legal name.

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the Menu button cannot open the overlay; the header links on wide screens and the footer links stay reachable. The market chart then shows 94 even ember stripes drawn by CSS, with no dark bank line. The questions are native details and open without it.
- The call-back form is a demo: with JavaScript it only checks the required fields, clears itself and shows the thank-you line; without it the form posts to #contact.
- The switch section pins for the whole sideways run of its panels: about 1,300 px of scrolling at 1440 px wide and 1,270 on a 375 px phone.
- The footer links to /privacy and /complaints do not exist on a static copy: point them to real pages.
- gsap, ScrollTrigger, SplitText and Lenis load from a CDN before the motion scripts; offline they are missing and the motion does not run.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Keylight Mortgages left only in class names.
