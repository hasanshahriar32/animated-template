# AGENTS.md: burger restaurant website template

One-page website for a burger bar or casual diner that wants a loud, friendly look. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:nav`: `.nav__more` `.nav__close`
  - `section-script:opening`: `.op-photo--b` `.op-photo__img`
  - `section-script:visit`: `.vs-form__status` `data-error` `data-sent`
  - `scene:menu`: `.mn-board` `.mn-item` `.mn-item__photo`
  - `scene:smash`: `.sm-stage` `.sm-photo` `.sm-head` `.sm-move`
  - `scene:room`: `.rm-story` `.rm-seam` `data-checks` `.rm-photo` `.rm-copy` `.rm-grid`
  - `scene:rules`: `.ru-wrap` `.ru-list`
  - `scene:talk`: `.tk-board` `.tk-quote`
  - `scene:footer-strip`: `.ft-strip__track`
- The scalloped stickers, the check strip in the footer and the check reveal are CSS shapes and gradients, not images: recolour them through the colour variables. The check reveal reads the data-checks attribute that the script sets on a photo while it arrives.
- The menu board is a two-column CSS grid of six cells with alternate rows reversed; the slide-in script reads the rows from the cells' positions, so keep an even number of burgers (add or remove them in pairs) to keep the checkerboard.
- The griddle photo is scaled taller than its strip and squeezed by the smash script; the image is set to 400% height inside a clipped frame, so keep the photo's wrapper and the image structure when you swap the picture.
- The rules section builds its black band from a copy of the list, so keep each rule as one list item with a text paragraph and a note paragraph; the copy is made on load.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #d7f36b (navigation bar, the lime menu cells, the pickles, rules and booking grounds, headings on dark bands, two of the six quote cards, footer check strip), `--color-2` #131510 (text, the thin rules between rows, the griddle and nights bands, the footer, the black band that crosses the house rules), `--color-3` #12801f (filled buttons, round icon buttons and the plus icons on the questions), `--color-4` #0b3a17 (the opening's text panel, every second menu cell, the quotes band and the hard shadows under buttons, cards and stickers), `--color-5` #ffffff (menu, room and questions grounds, sticker faces, four of the quote cards and the booking form, text on the dark bands), `--color-6` #e2382a (only the small diamond above the text on each sticker); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, phone, map, email, form, social): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Book a booth (6+) link in the top bar and the Book a booth button in the phone menu: now #book, the booking form near the end of the page; owner's target: your booking page (OpenTable, SevenRooms, Resy) if you use one, or keep #book once the form is connected.
- Map pin button in the top bar: now #visit, the visit section; owner's target: keep it, or point it at your Google Maps listing.
- Phone buttons and links (top bar, questions, visit section, footer): now a tel: link to the demo number; owner's target: your bar's phone number as tel:+44....
- Open in maps link in the visit section: now a Google Maps search for Glasgow; owner's target: the Google Maps link of your bar.
- See the menu button in the opening: now #menu; owner's target: keep it, or link a PDF or online ordering page.
- Request the booth button in the booking form: now submits the form to nothing; a script shows the thank-you line and resets the fields; owner's target: a form service (Formspree, Netlify Forms) or your booking system.
- The form in `#visit` (fields `name`, `phone`, `date`, `time`, `party`, `note`) sends nothing; `section-script:visit` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Dilly's (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (14, Unsplash: opening 1, menu 6, smash 1, pickles 1, room 3, nights 1, visit 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Known limits
- Lighthouse lists gsap, ScrollTrigger and Lenis as render-blocking; they sit at the end of body and the motion scripts after them need them loaded.
- Without JavaScript the phone menu button cannot open its sheet (the sheet is hidden by an attribute the script removes), and the booking form cannot show its thank-you line; the FAQ answers still open and the footer links stay reachable.
- The booking form sends nothing: the button only shows the thank-you line, so connect a form service or your booking system before publishing.
- On screens under 900 px wide or 640 px tall the griddle scene, and under 900 px wide the room scene, switch to lighter versions without the held stage.
- The stylesheet still carries rules for a lime hero with a band and a sticker that no markup uses; they can be deleted.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Dilly's left only in class names.
