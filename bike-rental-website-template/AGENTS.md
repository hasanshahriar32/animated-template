# AGENTS.md: bike rental website template

One-page website for an e-bike or bike hire business with several pick-up stands and guided rides. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `scene:fleet`: `.fleet__track` `.fleet__stage` `.fleet__bike` `.fleet__photo` `.fleet__text`
  - `scene:routes`: `.routes__track` `.routes__stage` `.routes__row` `.routes__rail` `.routes__fill` `.routes__wheel`
  - `scene:hire`: `.hire__fill` `.hire__step` `.hire__body` `.hire__num` `.hire__steps`
  - `scene:rides`: `.rides__stage` `.rides__band` `.rides__half`
  - `scene:reviews`: `.reviews__lanes` `.reviews__lane`
  - `scene:contact`: `.contact__band` `.contact__m`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.contact__form` `.contact__status`
  - `section-script:nav`: `.nav__bar` `.nav__menu` `.menu` `.menu__close` `.menu__list`
- The fleet scene builds its tab strip from the h3 of each bike and sizes the held stage from the number of bikes, so you can add or remove a bike article; keep each bike's h3 short because it becomes a tab.
- The letters A to E on the stands photo and on the night photo at the end are plain static spans; if you change the number of stands, edit those letters by hand as well as the five stand rows and the collect-from options.
- The routes row is as wide as its panels: the scene reads the row's overflow, so add or remove panels freely, but keep them in one row inside .routes__row.
- The brand mark (starburst in the nav, square mark with a lime plus in the headings and footer) is drawn with CSS and inline SVG: recolour it through the CSS variables.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #e1e3e2 (page ground and navigation bar; text and square marks on the dark bands and in the menu overlay), `--color-2` #0d0f0f (text, filled buttons and rules; ground of the first screen, stands, rides, footer and menu overlay), `--color-3` #d4ff1e (the only accent: last heading line of the first screen, button hover fill, round discs, progress lines, stand codes, the reviews band and the monthly pass card), `--color-4` #ffffff (button labels, text on the hire and rides bands, photo captions), `--color-5` #555c5e (small labels, bike kinds, spec terms, route facts, kit text, table heads, form labels and FAQ answers), `--color-6` #27333a (ground of the hire band, the multiply tint over night and band photos, and the placeholder behind photos), `--color-7` #a9b1b3 (grey text and rules on dark: the four first-screen facts, stand descriptions, ride dates, hire track, footer heads and legal line); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, phone, email, form, social): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Book a bike button in the first screen, and Join a ride and Ask about a pass buttons: now #contact, the booking form; owner's target: your booking page URL (a booking tool or rental system) if you take bookings there, or keep them on the form.
- Instagram and Strava club links in the footer: now the root of each network (instagram.com, strava.com); owner's target: your own profile and club URLs.
- Newsletter link in the footer: now #contact, the booking form (the page has no newsletter form); owner's target: your newsletter sign-up URL, or remove the link.
- See the four bikes link in the first screen and the menu links: now anchors (#fleet, #stands, #routes, #hire, #rides, #prices, #contact); owner's target: keep them as anchors.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `email`, `date`, `bike`, `stand`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Kickstand (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (13, Unsplash: opening 1, fleet 4, stands 1, routes 4, kit 1, rides 1, contact 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the menu button cannot open the overlay; the eight header links stay on wide screens, but on phones they are hidden and only the footer links remain. Without the script the booking form posts to the page itself (action "#"); with it, it sends nothing.
- The header hides when you scroll down and its hover transitions keep running with reduced motion; the scroll scenes, the entrances, the opening keyframes and smooth scrolling stop.
- The fleet stage holds the page for about 2.3 screens of scrolling (234svh with four bikes) and the routes stage for the row's whole overflow, so the page feels long on a short phone screen.
- GSAP, ScrollTrigger and Lenis load from a CDN at the end of the body and the scenes need all three.
- The footer link "Newsletter" points at the booking form, since the page has no newsletter form.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Kickstand left only in class names.
