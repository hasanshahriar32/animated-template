# AGENTS.md: movie theater website template

One-page website for an independent cinema, film club or small screening venue that wants a weekly programme, a bar and a membership. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:site-nav`: `.nav__menu` `.nav__close`
  - `section-script:visit`: `.visit__form` `.visit__status`
  - `scene:programme`: `.programme__days` `.programme__day` `.programme__still` `.programme__pane`
  - `scene:booth`: `.booth__run` `.booth__strip` `.booth__shutter` `.booth__perf` `.m-perf-2__track`
  - `scene:picks`: `.picks__notes` `.picks__note`
  - `scene:membership`: `.membership__ticket` `.membership__sheet` `.membership__stub` `.membership__perf-row` `.membership__perf` `.m-perf__track` `.m-perf-2__track`
  - `scene:seasons`: `.seasons__pin` `.seasons__track` `.m-window__pane`
  - `scene:visit`: `.visit__head` `.visit__window` `.m-window__pane` `.m-text-7`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Halide` is 6.
- The programme scene pairs the six day tiles with the six stills by position; add or remove a day and a still together. The booth scene reads its frames from the list, so the count of frames can change.
- The footer wordmark gets its size from style="--len:6", the number of characters in Halide: update it when the name changes.
- The perforation strips, sprocket columns, tilted windows and the gate frame are CSS: recolour them through the variables in :root (the strips and the gate use --color-1, --color-2 and --color-5).
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #121214 (page ground, text on white, mint and lavender tiles, label on the lavender buttons, the phone menu ground and the shutter flash over the booth frames), `--color-2` #ffffff (nav bar, white tiles and question tiles, text on the dark ground, the visit section once it has brightened, the lit programme day), `--color-3` #b8a4f7 (main buttons, lavender tiles (the Book a seat tile, the second programmer, the membership stub, the visit form, one season panel), focus outline, hover tint on programme rows, the open-question marker), `--color-4` #8cf2e6 (mint tiles: the doors tile on the first screen, the first programmer, the questions heading tile and one season panel), `--color-5` #222226 (the film gate frame in the booth, the perforation strips in the rooms section and the footer, the background behind photos while they load), `--color-6` #a9a9b3 (secondary text on the dark ground: section intro lines, room descriptions, programme notes, bar note, footer address, text inside the dark visit tiles), `--color-7` #55555e (secondary text on white, mint and lavender tiles: first-screen captions, question answers, the visit intro line after it brightens); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, email, map, phone, form, social): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Book tickets buttons in the nav and the phone menu, and the Book a seat button on the first screen: now #programme; owner's target: your ticketing page or booking widget.
- Every film time link in the six-day programme: now #visit; owner's target: the booking page for that screening (one link per showing).
- Join Halide button in the membership ticket: now #visit; owner's target: your membership sign-up page.
- Open the map link in the visit section: now an OpenStreetMap search for Leith Edinburgh; owner's target: a map link to your venue.
- Newsletter link in the footer pill row, and the Send me the monthly programme checkbox in the form: now #visit (the link); the checkbox is sent with the form, which sends nothing yet; owner's target: your mailing-list sign-up page, and a form service for the checkbox.
- The form in `#visit` (fields `name`, `email`, `message`, `newsletter`) sends nothing; `section-script:visit` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Halide (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (22, Unsplash: opening 1, programme 6, booth 4, rooms 2, picks 2, bar 2, seasons 4, visit 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the phone menu button cannot open the overlay (the Book tickets button and the six footer links still work), and the message form submits to the page itself; with or without JavaScript it sends nothing until a form service is connected.
- The six questions are native details elements and open without JavaScript.
- The booth gate holds the page for about two screens of scroll and the seasons track for about two and a half at 1440 by 900 (a little over one on a phone); with reduced motion or without JavaScript they fall back to a column of captioned photos and a grid of panels.
- The nav hide-on-scroll and the hover effects keep running with reduced motion; the GSAP scenes, the entrance animations and smooth scrolling are switched off.
- The CSS turns every photo greyscale (filter: grayscale(1)), so colour photos also show in black and white; remove the filter to show colour. The booth captions sit on white plates, so they stay readable over any photo.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Halide left only in class names.
