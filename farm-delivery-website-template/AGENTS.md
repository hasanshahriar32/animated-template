# AGENTS.md: farm delivery website template

One-page website for an organic veg box or farm delivery scheme that serves local postcodes. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:nav`: `.nav__menu` `.menu__close`
  - `section-script:boxes`: `.bo-slip` `.bo-price` `.bo-when` `.bo-fit` `data-price` `data-label` `data-fit`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.ct-form` `data-state` `.ct-areas` `data-prefix` `data-slot` `data-day`
  - `scene:box-field`: `.bx-field` `.bx-rows` `.bx-photo`
  - `scene:growers-stack`: `.gr-card` `.gr-card__photo` `.gr-card__inner` `.gr-card__shade`
  - `scene:day-track`: `.dy-track`
  - `scene:promises-dial`: `.pr-list` `.pr-item` `.pr-star` `.m-star__arm`
  - `scene:recipes-deal`: `.rc-grid` `.rc-card`
  - `scene:contact-open`: `.ct-slip` `.ct-slip__ground` `.ct-media`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `FURROW` is 6.
- The postcode check is a script that takes the first one or two letters of what is typed and looks for a row in the area list with the same data-prefix; the day shown comes from its data-day. Add or change areas by editing those rows; a prefix is one or two letters, such as SE or BN.
- The box builder reads data-price, data-fit and data-label on its inputs, so a new size or extra needs those attributes and a matching price in the visible label.
- The six promises pair with the six arms of the asterisk by order in the promises scene: keep the number of promises and arms equal.
- The asterisk, the dot grids and the star on buttons are inline SVG and CSS, not images: recolour them through the colour variables in :root (lime is --color-1, near-black --color-2).
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #c9e36b (nav bar and menu overlay, growers and promises grounds, the lime cards (opening, box builder, contact), the footer button and wordmark, the star on near-black buttons), `--color-2` #131512 (text, rules, the near-black buttons, grower and returns panels, recipes and footer grounds, selected choices, the last colour of the day section), `--color-3` #ffffff (box, boxes and questions grounds, the day and recipe cards, the promises asterisk, text on near-black), `--color-4` #c4c7be (secondary text and rules on dark grounds, footer headings and small print, the returns and footer dot grids), `--color-5` #5c6257 (secondary text on white: leads, farm lines in the box rows, notes, times, recipe meta, answers, the field placeholder); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, form, email, phone): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Start a box button in the top bar, the menu and the footer: now #boxes (the box builder); owner's target: your sign-up or checkout URL.
- Build your box button in the opening: now #boxes; owner's target: your sign-up or checkout URL, or keep it on the builder.
- Check my postcode button under the box builder: now #contact (the postcode check); owner's target: your checkout with the chosen size and extras, or keep it on the postcode check.
- How returns work link in the returns section: now #faq; owner's target: your returns page, or keep it on the FAQ.
- The postcode check (Check button and the six area rows): now a script that reads the first letters of the postcode against six areas and shows a day or a no; owner's target: your own delivery areas and days (change each row's data-prefix and data-day), or a call to your delivery-area service.
- The form in `#boxes` (fields `size`, `often`, `extra`) sends nothing; `section-script:boxes` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `postcode`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Furrow (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (23, Unsplash: opening 1, box 7, growers 4, day 5, returns 1, recipes 4, contact 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the menu button cannot open the overlay, the box builder total stays at the starting £23.00, and the postcode Check button reloads the page without an answer.
- The postcode check and the box builder are demo scripts and send nothing; connect them to your own checkout and delivery data.
- The top bar hides while you scroll down and returns on scroll up, also with reduced motion on.
- The day section holds the screen for as far as the track overflows the screen width, which feels long on a phone.
- gsap, ScrollTrigger, SplitText and Lenis load from jsDelivr at the end of body; if the CDN fails, the page still reads in full but without motion or smooth scrolling.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Furrow left only in class names.
