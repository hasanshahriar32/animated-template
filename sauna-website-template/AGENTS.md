# AGENTS.md: sauna website template

One-page website for a sauna and bathing house or day spa with a lake, timed passes and a booking request form. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:header`: `.hd-menu` `.mn-close`
  - `section-script:arrival`: `.op-veil`
  - `scene:arrival`: `.op-first` `.op-hold` `.op-lake` `.op-veil` `.op-room` `.op-room-dark` `.op-line` `.op-float` `data-depth`
  - `scene:round-frame`: `.rd-steps` `.rd-shot--heat` `.rd-shot--cold` `.rd-shot--rest` `.rd-tint--hot` `.rd-tint--cold`
  - `section-script:saunas`: `.sa-row`
  - `scene:saunas-heat`: `.sa-row` `.sa-line`
  - `scene:steam-wave`: `.st-lines` `.st-glow` `.st-line`
  - `scene:day-light`: `.dy-morning` `.dy-night` `.dy-tint--dawn` `.dy-tint--dusk` `.dy-hour`
  - `scene:house-slats`: `.hs-photo`
  - `section-script:passes`: `.ps-pass` `data-from` `data-to`
  - `scene:passes-hours`: `.ps-board` `.ps-axis` `.ps-marker` `.ps-pass` `data-from` `data-to`
  - `section-script:visit`: `.vs-form` `.vs-status` `data-ok` `data-error`
  - `scene:visit-name`: `.vs-name`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Water on the stones.` is 20, `A breath of heat` is 16, `rolls off the ceiling` is 21, `and the room` is 12, `goes quiet.` is 11, `Brume` is 5.
- The four sauna rows and the line lengths come from each temperature's data value (value as a percent of the track). Keep values between 0 and 100, and keep the visible text in step.
- The five statement lines each carry style="--len:N", the number of characters with spaces and punctuation, which sets the font size so the line fits the width. Change N when you change a line.
- The passes read data-from and data-to (hours on a 24-hour clock, axis 08 to 22) for their bands and for the marker scene. The axis labels are separate text.
- The rest, round and day photos are stacked layers (heat over cold over rest; morning under night) written by their scenes, so replace them with photos of the same shape and keep the order.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #0b0906 (page ground, the menu overlay, the solid header, text on a filled button when hovered), `--color-2` #dcd8d1 (body and heading text, button borders and hover fills, focus outlines, fog patches), `--color-3` #9a948a (section rails, field labels, captions, small notes, form field underlines), `--color-4` #2b2620 (hairlines between steps, dishes, questions and passes; borders of the form panel and menu button), `--color-5` #d0703f (copper for heat: hot readings and temperatures, step meta, line ends, the lit hour, open pass bands, the pass marker, the statement glow), `--color-6` #8fb2b8 (lake blue for cold: cold readings and temperatures, the start of the temperature lines, the cold and dawn tints, one fog patch), `--color-7` #15120e (the request form panel, photo placeholders and the dropdown option backgrounds), `--color-8` #091114 (cold end of the sauna section's ground, a blue-black), `--color-9` #1b0d07 (hot end of the sauna section's ground, a brown-black); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, phone, email, form, social): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Book a day buttons in the bar, the opening and the footer, the Come and see it link in the house section, and the pass links Book a morning, Book a full day and Book an evening: now the #visit anchor (the request form); owner's target: your online booking page, or keep #visit once the form is connected.
- Send request button in the form: now does not send anything: the form action is #, and section-script:visit checks the required fields, shows the thank-you or error line and resets the form; owner's target: a form service (Formspree, Netlify Forms), your own endpoint, or a link to your booking system.
- Instagram link in the footer: now https://instagram.com/ (the Instagram home page); owner's target: your Instagram profile, or remove it.
- Phone and email links in the contact details and the footer: now tel: and mailto: placeholders; owner's target: your real phone number and email address.
- The form in `#visit` (fields `date`, `guests`, `pass`, `name`, `email`, `note`) sends nothing. Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it.
- The name Brume (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (20, Unsplash: opening 5, ritual 3, rooms 4, statement 1, lake 1, schedule 2, kitchen 3, house 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for
All demo text, never to be invented:
- Passes and prices: Morning 08:00-12:00 £38, Full day 08:00-22:00 £64 including lunch, Evening 17:00-22:00 £42 (passes, form options); every pass includes a robe, towels, all four saunas, the lake and tea.

The hero and the passes say four saunas, while the rooms list three heated rooms and the jetty: make them agree.
- Hours and closures: daily 08:00-22:00, smoke sauna Thursday to Sunday from 15:00 heated for six hours, closed 24-25 December; the day's timetable (opening, rooms, schedule, contact, footer).
- The lake: Ellery Water, springs-fed, ladder depth 3.5 m, a 64-metre boardwalk, an ice channel from December to March, a lifeguard at weekends (rooms, lake).
- Getting there: forty minutes by train from the city to Holm, a shuttle of six minutes or a shore path of twenty-five, parking for twelve cars (contact, footer).
- Address: "Example Lane 1, Holm, on Ellery Water" (contact, footer, menu overlay); the phone +44 20 0000 0000 and hello@brume.example are placeholders.
- Rules and policies: no phones past the changing room, mixed bathing except women-only Tuesday evenings, under-16s free with an adult on weekend mornings, gift cards valid for a year (opening, faq, passes).
- Hosted rounds: a host walks first-timers through the round at ten and at three; the sauna masters pour every twenty minutes with birch, mint or tar (faq, statement, schedule).
- Health advice: pregnancy and heart conditions should ask a doctor first (faq).
- Company facts: "Ten years on", the Brume Baths name in the copyright, and charred larch, alder and aspen, wood from the owner's forest (opening, house, footer).
- Food sources: a smokehouse, a baker in the village who sends bread at seven, pickles from the cellar (kitchen, schedule).

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the menu button does nothing and the five top links are hidden on narrow screens; the footer repeats The round, Saunas, A day, Passes and Questions. Without JavaScript the temperature lines also stay empty and all three pass bands span the whole 08 to 22 axis.
- The form does not send anything yet: the action is # and the thank-you line comes from a script.
- The opening, the round and the day use sticky stages with scrubbed layers (fog, photos, tints) and a fixed 100vh stage, so on very short windows the held frame can crop its photo.
- GSAP, ScrollTrigger, SplitText and Lenis load from jsDelivr; without them the scenes do not run.
- The header hide-on-scroll and the hover states keep working with reduced motion; the scenes do not.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Brume left only in class names.
