# AGENTS.md: glamping website template

One-page website for a glamping or remote cabin business that rents a handful of stays on a few sites. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:navigation`: `.nav__bar` `.nav__menu` `.nav__overlay` `.nav__close`
  - `section-script:opening`: `.op__search` `.op__stage`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.contact__form` `.contact__status` `data-sent` `data-missing`
  - `scene:opening`: `.op__stage` `.op__rim` `.op__window` `.op__fg` `.op__drift` `.op__title` `.op__title-wrap` `.op__dusk` `.op__night` `.op__search` `.op__lead` `.op__rail` `.op__card-l` `.op__card-r` `.op__seal`
  - `scene:ridges`: `.ridges__stage` `.ridge` `.ridge__frame` `.ridge__card`
  - `scene:stays`: `.stay` `.stay__card` `.stay__frame`
  - `scene:night`: `.night__ground` `.moment` `.moment__frame`
  - `scene:hosts`: `.hosts__list` `.host` `.host__photo` `.m-text-5`
  - `scene:pledge`: `.pledge__rule` `.pledge__line` `.pledge__note`
  - `scene:notes`: `.notes__stage` `.note` `.notes__list` `.notes__photo`
  - `scene:contact`: `.contact__side` `.contact__ground` `.contact__title`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Farlight` is 8.
- The heading in the first screen sets behind a cut-out copy of the cabin photo: the polygon points in scene:opening (the shape array, fractions of the photo) outline the cabin and the snowfield, and both image copies share the same src and width and height attributes. A new hero photo needs its own points and both copies updated, or the heading sinks behind the wrong silhouette.
- The footer wordmark is sized from style="--len:8", the number of characters of the name; set it to the length of the new name.
- The scenes read colours from the CSS variables on :root at run time (the night section from the colours of its five moments, the pledge from --color-5, --color-7 and --color-3, the contact section from --color-4, --color-8, --color-2 and --color-3): recolour the page through them, not through the scripts.
- The stay finder in the first screen and the booking form share the same options; keep the option lists identical, since section-script:opening copies the chosen values into the selects #contact-ridge, #contact-stay and #contact-nights, and a value missing from the form's list leaves that select empty.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #eef0f7 (page ground of the first screen, ridges, stays, supper, getting-there, guestbook and questions sections, and the fill of the form fields), `--color-2` #211c55 (body text, filled buttons, the rail icons, step discs, the Firelight moment ground and the text on the rose contact ground), `--color-3` #ffffff (photo frame borders, white cards, the pill buttons, the current rail mark, the hosts section ground and text on dark grounds), `--color-4` #0d0b27 (the second screen, menu panel, pledge and footer grounds, the Starlight moment and the start of the contact ground), `--color-5` #f2783f (the only accent: round button discs, the top of the logo mark, arrow strokes, the open question sign and the pledge lines while they burn), `--color-6` #57547a (lead paragraphs, field labels, captions and secondary card text), `--color-7` #b8c1ee (periwinkle for pledge lines after they switch off, the footer wordmark, the shuttle note band, the status line and muted text on dark grounds), `--color-8` #e7b6cb (dawn rose for the Last light and First light moments, the contact ground and the pink glow over the first photo), `--color-9` #323d80 (the Blue hour moment ground and the base behind the first photo window); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, phone, form, email): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Check dates button in the stay finder of the first screen: now does not search: a script copies the chosen ridge, stay and nights into the booking form and scrolls to #contact; owner's target: your booking engine or availability page (pass the three choices as parameters), or keep it as a shortcut to the request form.
- Book a stay buttons in the header and the menu: now #contact; owner's target: your booking page URL if you take bookings elsewhere, or keep it on the request form.
- Ask for dates buttons under each of the four stays: now #contact; owner's target: a booking link for that stay, or keep them on the request form.
- Add supper to a stay button in the supper section: now #contact; owner's target: your supper add-on or extras page, or keep it on the request form.
- Book a seat button under the route in the getting-there section: now #contact; owner's target: your shuttle booking page, or keep it on the request form.
- Send request button of the booking form: now a script checks name and email and shows a thank-you line; nothing is sent (the form has action="#"); owner's target: a form service (Formspree, Netlify Forms) or your booking system, or remove the form and keep the phone and email.
- Phone links in the menu, the questions section, the contact section and the footer; email links in the contact section and the footer: now tel: links and mailto: links; owner's target: your own phone and email.
- The form in `#opening` (fields `ridge`, `stay`, `nights`) sends nothing; `section-script:opening` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `email`, `ridge`, `stay`, `arrival`, `nights`, `message`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Farlight (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (23, Unsplash: opening 6, hosts 4, faq 1, stays 4, ridges 4, night 5, table 3, arrival 1, notes 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for
All demo text, never to be invented:
- Number of stays and layout: "38 stays on four ridges" (opening), "Six to twelve stays a ridge, never more" (ridges, with 12, 8, 10 and 8 stays), "400 metres from the next" (opening).
- Ridge names, places, altitudes and drive times: Snowline 2,450 m, 3 h 40 from Reno; Red Bench 1,900 m, 2 h 50 from St. George; Salt Rim 1,700 m, 3 h from Las Vegas; Juniper Mesa 2,100 m, 1 h 30 from Flagstaff (ridges, getting there).
- Nightly prices: Rim Cabin $310, Glass Dome $260, Shell Pod $240, Canvas Suite $190 (stays); supper box "For two, with the wood $64" (supper); dogs "$30 a night" (FAQ).
- Stay specs: sizes in square metres, sleeps 2 or 4, wood stove, deep bath, telescope, 180 degree window, terrace, two rooms (opening card, stays).
- Operating details: arrival "around four", lamps off "at ten", breakfast "at eight", supper delivered at "6 pm" (one night, supper), "no streetlights for forty miles" (opening).
- Host names and ridges: Mara Quint, Eli Navarro, Walt Brennan, June Okafor, and "Mara answers the phone from eight to eight" (hosts, FAQ, menu).
- Policies: cancellation "up to fourteen days before arrival for a full refund" then one free date move within twelve months; the free night after a cloudy stay, usable "within a year"; "Nothing is charged until you confirm the dates" (FAQ, contact).
- Facilities and rules: wifi only in the gate cabin and a landline, stoves and heating per stay type, children only in the canvas suites at Juniper Mesa, dogs only in the Rim Cabins at Snowline, water from the ridge's own well, four-wheel drive "only from December to March" (FAQ, getting there).
- Shuttle: "leaves the last town at 2 pm on Fridays and Sundays" and the gravel distance "six miles" (getting there).
- Guest notes: six quotes with invented names, ridges and months (notes); never present them as real reviews.
- Dark-sky pledge: five rules and the claim that they are "written into our leases with the land" (pledge).
- Seasonal claims: skis by the door "from December to April" at Snowline, "the darkest sky of the four" at Red Bench, "the mildest winters" at Juniper Mesa (ridges).
- Contact details: phone (menu, questions, contact, footer), email and the office "1 Example Street, Bishop, California" (contact, footer), and the company name in the copyright line "Farlight Camps".

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the menu button cannot open the panel; the links stay reachable in the footer and the rail. The booking form does nothing useful: it has no sending code, and the stay finder only jumps to the form without carrying the choices.
- The cut-out copy of the cabin photo stays hidden until the scene script runs, so without JavaScript the heading sits plainly over the photo.
- On phones the white "Find Your Own Ridge" card is hidden under 720 px, the section rail only appears from 1024 px, and on phones shorter than 700 px the first-screen paragraph is hidden too.
- The ridges frame is pinned and the opening is a sticky screen of at least 560 px, so short or landscape screens show tightly packed windows.
- gsap, ScrollTrigger, SplitText and Lenis load from jsDelivr at the end of the body; if the CDN fails, the page still reads in full but stays still. The three 46 px round thumbnails in the first screen carry a srcset of 1020 and 1290 px images, and three stay photos repeat their src attribute: trim both when you swap photos.
- The opening stage is sticky for one screen even with reduced motion, so the night screen slides over the first photo; the heading then stays over the photo without the cut-out.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Farlight left only in class names.
