# AGENTS.md: tailor website template

One-page website for a bespoke tailor or made-to-order clothier that takes fittings in a workroom and on tour. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:nav`: `.nv-menu` `.nv-overlay` `.nv-close`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.co-form` `.co-status` `.co-done`
  - `scene:cloth-board`: `.cl-stage` `.cl-board` `.cl-sticker` `.cl-bolt`
  - `scene:fittings-track`: `.ft-stage` `.ft-view` `.ft-track` `.ft-dash` `.ft-progress` `.ft-step` `.m-rule__line` `.ft-photo`
  - `scene:cut-ease`: `.ct-trait` `.ct-word` `.m-spark` `.ct-photo` `.ct-body`
  - `scene:visits-stamp`: `.vs-list` `.vs-roller` `.vs-item`
  - `scene:archive-bands`: `.ar-photo`
  - `scene:contact-close`: `.co-title-row` `.co-word--a` `.co-word__in` `.co-word--b` `.co-dash__bar`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Soft shoulder` is 13, `High armhole` is 12, `Long roll` is 9, `Clean back` is 10, `Come in` is 7, `Haldane` is 7.
- The text ring on the gold stamp is an SVG textPath with a fixed textLength="268" and the brand name in its text; when you rename, keep the ring about the same length or change textLength to fit.
- Each trait word in the house cut and the headline "Come in" carry an inline style="--len:N" that sizes them; set N to the number of characters of your new text. The footer wordmark carries --len:7 the same way.
- The sparkles, the stamp and the hairlines are CSS and SVG, not images: recolour them through the colour variables in :root (gold is --color-4, the deep green --color-3).
- The fittings stage height is set by its scene from the track width, and the progress sparkles are made one per step; the cloth row is a CSS grid with one column per swatch (three per row on phones) inside a fixed 210vh stage. Adding or removing a step or a swatch needs no other change.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #121413 (page ground, header bar fill once you scroll, text on the gold stamp, hover fill of the opening button), `--color-2` #f3f2ee (main text, hairline dashes under the steps, outlines of buttons, the dash in the contact headline), `--color-3` #1d5a49 (ground of the full-height opening panel, hover fill of most buttons, the green glow under portrait stickers), `--color-4` #e2a73c (gold: focus outlines, step labels, trunk show outlines and sparkles, the stamp, lit progress sparkles, ring around a sticker on hover), `--color-5` #c2c8c4 (secondary text: notes, cloth mills, form labels, FAQ answers), `--color-6` #3b403d (hairlines, price row dividers, the unfilled progress line and its unlit sparkles), `--color-7` #1c201e (ground behind photos while they load, and the background of the form's select list); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, phone, email, form, social): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Book a fitting online button in the top bar and the menu: now #contact (the request form at the bottom); owner's target: your booking page URL (Calendly, Cal.com) if fittings are booked online, or keep it on the form.
- Book your first fitting button in the opening: now #contact; owner's target: your booking page URL, or keep it on the form.
- Order cuttings by post button in the cloth section: now #contact; owner's target: your cuttings request page or form.
- Book a slot links in the trunk shows list (five cities): now #contact; owner's target: a booking link for each city and date, or the form.
- Privacy and Terms links in the footer: now #privacy and #terms, which do not exist on the page, so the links go nowhere; owner's target: your privacy and terms pages.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `email`, `where`, `phone`, `message`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` handles its submit in the page (read it before you connect a service). Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Haldane (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (18, Unsplash: opening 2, cloth 6, fittings 4, cutters 3, cut 1, archive 1, contact 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for
All demo text, never to be invented:
- Process promises: "Twelve weeks from the first measure to collection", "Around eighty hours of hand work in every coat", "Your pattern kept on file for as long as you wear us" (opening); "Twenty-six measures" (fittings).
- Cloth library: "Four hundred cloths", mills in the Scottish Borders, Huddersfield and Biella, and the six swatches with their mills and weights, for example "Yorkshire · 13 oz" (cloth).
- Fitting schedule: twelve weeks, three fittings three to four weeks apart, a second suit from the same pattern in around eight weeks (fittings, FAQ).
- People: Isla Rennie (head cutter, "twenty-two years at the board"), Morag Duthie (coatmaker), Anh Tran (finisher); the portraits are stock photos (cutters).
- Prices and terms: Two-piece suit from £3,400, Three-piece from £3,950, Sports coat from £2,450, Overcoat from £3,800, Trousers from £980, with weeks and fittings for each; cloth from house bunches, a year of free alterations and a half deposit (commissions).
- Trunk shows: London (Mayfair, 4 to 6 November), Manchester (Spinningfields, 13 to 14 November), Copenhagen (Indre By, 21 to 22 November), New York (Upper East Side, 2 to 5 December), Glasgow (Merchant City, 15 to 16 January), "twice a year" (visits, FAQ).
- Archive and aftercare: reorders with a single fitting, free alterations for the first year, repairs and repressing at cost, for life (archive).
- Claims in the FAQ: "About a third of the cutting book" is for women, patterns drawn from nothing rather than adjusted from a block, a new pattern always cut instead of tracing an owned suit (FAQ).
- Hours and place: Tuesday to Saturday, 10:00 to 18:00, evenings by appointment; "1 Example Street, Edinburgh EH1 0ZZ" (contact, footer, menu).
- Service: "A cutter will reply within one working day with fitting times" (the form's thank-you line) and "A first fitting takes an hour" (contact).
- Footer: "© 2026 Haldane Bespoke Tailors Ltd"; put in your legal name.

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the Menu button cannot open the overlay, and under 860 px the top links are hidden, so only the footer links stay reachable.
- The Privacy and Terms links in the footer point at anchors that do not exist yet.
- The request form sends nothing: it shows the thank-you line after a check, so connect it to Formspree, Netlify Forms or your own endpoint.
- The top bar hides while you scroll down and returns on scroll up, also with reduced motion on.
- The cloth and fittings sections hold the screen while you scroll: about 1.1 screens for the cloth and about 3.3 to 4.2 screens for the sideways fittings track (measured at 390 to 1920 px wide), which feels long on laptop screens.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Haldane left only in class names.
