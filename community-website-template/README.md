# Free HTML community website template with scroll animations and no libraries

Community website template: a one-page site for a members' house, club or network that meets in person, with a seven-day programme, four clubs, a small shop, a journal and three membership tiers. The look is cream, oxblood and pink, with arch photos and a serif mixing hairline and bold. Its scroll motion runs on CSS with no JavaScript libraries, in one HTML file with an AGENTS.md for an AI agent.

## Use it with Claude Code, Cursor or Codex

Download the four files into your project folder (`curl.exe` in Windows PowerShell):

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8bsite/community-website-template/main/index.html
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8bsite/community-website-template/main/AGENTS.md
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8bsite/community-website-template/main/LICENSE
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8bsite/community-website-template/main/CREDITS.md
```

Then fill in the angle brackets and give your agent this prompt:

```text
Read AGENTS.md, then edit index.html. Rework this into a site for <my community: who it is for, where it meets, opening hours, the weekly programme with days and times, the clubs or groups, membership tiers with prices, perks and terms, anything I sell, how people apply or pay>. Set each --len number to its new character count. Motion is CSS scroll-driven animation plus the inline motion kit: keep the gate script in the head, the section ids, the data-8b-* attributes and the classes AGENTS.md lists; add no animation library. Never invent prices, hours, addresses, member numbers, founders, reviews or contacts; ask me.
```

As a community website template for Claude Code, Cursor or Codex, it suits vibe coding, which goes faster when the agent gets the facts first: where the community meets, opening hours, the weekly programme, the clubs, and tier prices with terms such as notice and pausing. It should ask for them and never invent member numbers, a founder or an address. The wordmark is split across tags in the navigation bar, hero and footer, so a search for the house name misses the visible letters in all three places. Keep the section ids and listed classes; the week's seven columns and the three tier columns on wide screens, and the moodboard's twelve grid areas, are built for those counts.

## Sections and motion

- **Navigation**: top bar: wordmark, section links, Join button; phone menu overlay.
- **First screen**: first screen: width-filling two-weight wordmark, tagline, intro, two buttons, portrait, a row of palette chips. On load the two halves of the name slide in, a star pops onto the i and twinkles, and six chips rise and bob. Scrolling away, the oxblood arch among them swells into a full-width dome as the name parts.
- **The softlife principle**: statement on an oxblood ground: the principle in two weights, a founding note and a link. Tied to scroll, the oxblood ground widens from the arch, then the statement thickens word by word and its key phrases turn pink.
- **A week, softly**: weekly programme: seven days as seven arch photos, one colour per day. Held in place on desktop, the seven arches rise one by one, their colour drops away and each photo settles from a zoom.
- **Four clubs, one house**: four tiles with a giant initial each: the clubs or programmes (demo: morning, supper, reading, office hours). Bold words in several headings thicken from hairline as they appear; each club tile drops in tilted and settles straight.
- **Things we're soft on**: moodboard collage of twelve tiles: photos, type posters, gingham and stripes. Held in place while you scroll, twelve tiles piled small and tilted in the centre deal out one by one into the collage.
- **The soft edit**: small shop: four products with photo, details, price and Add to bag. On wide screens a sticky photo frame stays beside the list, and from the second product on, its coloured panel and arch photo wipe up into it.
- **Notes from the reading room**: blog: a tall pink poster of two words beside three article entries. Tied to scroll, the two words on the pink poster slide together to the middle, then apart.
- **Dear you,**: founder's letter with a handwritten signature and an arch portrait. The founder's signature inks in from left to right, and the big motto beneath slides away to the right.
- **Join the club**: three membership tiers on cards that turn over (demo: day pass, member, founding circle). Tied to scroll, the heading slides in from the left and the three tier cards turn over one after another.
- **Good questions**: questions and answers (native &lt;details&gt;) beside a heading and an email link.
- **Come over**: address, hours, email, phone and a contact form beside an arch photo of the front door. Two oxblood door leaves over the front-door photo slide open as you scroll, and the photo settles.
- **Footer**: width-filling softlife wordmark, address, hours, contacts, links, copyright and the Design: 8B credit.

**Kalnia**: headings: serif mixing hairline and bold. **Onest**: light body text, spaced capital labels. **Playwrite US Trad**: handwritten signature and script accent (Google Fonts). Many photos sit in arches with only the upper edge rounded, panels have large soft corners, and the name fills the full width. Most section headings pair a thin phrase with a bold one. The moodboard is a collage of photos, type posters, gingham and stripes, in six columns from 768 px wide and three below.

## Questions

**Can it work as a membership website template with logins and payments?**  
No. It covers the public side only: three tier cards, a shop, a journal and a contact form. There is no login, member area or payment step. The Join button and the tier buttons link to #membership and #contact now, so point each one at your own sign-up or payment page.

**Will the form send anything once I publish the page?**  
No. As shipped, the form asks for a name, an email, what the visitor would like (four options, from a day pass to a private supper) and a note, then checks the fields, shows a thank-you line and resets, sending nothing. Connect Formspree or Netlify Forms, or remove the form and keep the email link. Also edit the promise of a reply within a day.

**Can I remove the shop or the journal?**  
Yes. Delete the section's markup, its styles, its scripts and any links to its id; AGENTS.md lists the steps. The Add to bag buttons are plain buttons with no cart behind them, so a club with nothing to sell is better off without the shop. The journal links point back to the journal until you give them article addresses.

## Is it the right base?

This membership site template is built around a place and a rhythm: a house with a weekly programme, standing clubs and a few paid tiers. If you rent desks by the day, the [coworking](https://8b.com/templates/isoline/) template fits better. This build looks and scrolls the same with no animation library and no script from a CDN: about 32 KB of code gzipped in one file, against 80 KB and four more requests for the GSAP version. The weak spot is everything after the click: there is no login, member area, event calendar or payment step, so each tier button needs your own link.

## Before you publish

- Replace what is marked `data-8b-placeholder` (social preview image, favicon, email, phone, form, social) and the invented demo facts; [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) lists them.
- The form sends nothing yet: connect it to Formspree or Netlify Forms, or remove it.

## Tech

No JavaScript libraries: CSS scroll-driven animations and a small inline motion script with its own smooth wheel scrolling, 130 KB, no build step. Chrome and Edge 111+, Safari 16.2+, Firefox 121+ (it uses color-mix(), container query units, :has(), cascade layers, small/dynamic viewport units). Without scroll-driven animations (Firefox today) the scroll motion and the smooth wheel are off and each section shows its finished layout, while any load-in or looping animation still plays; with "reduce motion" on, the page is complete and nothing moves on its own (hover effects stay).

A GSAP build of the same page is [`index.gsap.html`](index.gsap.html): GSAP 3.13.0, ScrollTrigger, SplitText, Lenis 1.3.11 from jsDelivr, 134 KB; its scroll motion also plays in Firefox. Use one of the two files.
