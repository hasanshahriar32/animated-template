# AGENTS.md: music school website template

One-page website for an online music school or lesson studio, with instrument programs, mentors, masterclasses, a sheet-music shop, plans and a free-lesson booking form. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:site-nav`: `.nav__menu-btn` `.nav__close`
  - `scene:programs-deal`: `.deck` `.program`
  - `scene:masterclass-zoom`: `.mc__hold` `.mc__stage` `.ticket--featured` `.ticket__photo` `.ticket__main` `.ticket__stub`
  - `scene:covers-iris`: `.track` `.covers__layer`
  - `scene:path-hop`: `.stairs` `.stair` `.stair__slot` `.path__marker`
  - `scene:reviews-ink`: `.reviews__quote` `.reviews__rating` `.m-diamond`
  - `scene:pricing-bridges`: `.plans` `.plan` `.plan-bridge`
  - `scene:contact-fold`: `.contact__cascade` `.contact__sq`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.contact__form` `.form-status`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Overtone` is 8.
- The footer wordmark size comes from style="--len:8", the number of characters in "Overtone". After a rename set --len to the new length. The name also appears in the nav logo, the phone overlay, the footer brand block and the copyright.
- Fixed counts: the path has exactly four steps and the pricing exactly three plans with two bridge drawings between them; the covers list has six rows and the disc six layers in the same order, and the scene matches them by position. Keep the numbers equal or edit the scene.
- The three-square logo, the cascade of squares, the disc's orange backdrop and centre hole, the barcode, the diamonds and the bridges are CSS and SVG, not images: recolour them through the colour variables in :root (--color-4 is the orange accent, --color-5 the pale yellow).
- Each cover appears twice, as a small image in its row and as a layer of the big disc; replace both with the same photo.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #ffffff (page background, nav pill, the odd program cards, the outer plan cards, the outer review cards and text on the dark lesson panel), `--color-2` #131313 (text, all outlines, primary buttons, the dark lesson panel, the mobile menu overlay, the active covers row), `--color-3` #e5dcd2 (beige cards: the two small tickets, middle plan, contact card, even program cards, the middle review card, alternate FAQ rows and the path band), `--color-4` #ff5714 (the accent: diamonds, the disc backdrop in the covers shop and the favicon tile), `--color-5` #f4f0a1 (pale yellow fill of the small buttons, discount badges and round icon buttons, plus the colour of a program card or small ticket while its button is hovered), `--color-6` #57524c (struck-through old prices and the mentors' one-line bios); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, form, email, phone): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Sign up buttons in the nav and the phone menu, and the Log in links in the nav and the footer: now #contact (the booking form); there is no account area; owner's target: your sign-up and login pages, or keep #contact and remove Log in if you have no accounts.
- Book a free lesson button and Choose an instrument link on the first screen: now #contact and #programs; owner's target: your booking page for the trial lesson; keep #programs for the link.
- The round arrow button on each of the five program cards: now #contact; owner's target: the booking page of that instrument, or a page about the program.
- Book a seat buttons on the three masterclass tickets and Get a seat in the stage nights card: now #contact; owner's target: your ticket or event page for that date.
- Add buttons on the six rows of the covers shop: now #contact; there is no cart; owner's target: your shop or checkout link for each arrangement.
- Start monthly, Start a term and Start family buttons in the plans: now #contact; owner's target: your checkout or subscription link for each plan.
- Ask a mentor link beside the FAQ heading: now #contact; owner's target: a support email or chat link.
- Book a free lesson submit button in the contact form: now no request: a script checks the required fields and shows the thank-you line; owner's target: your form service (the form action is #contact with method post).
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `email`, `instrument`, `message`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` validates it and shows the thank-you text. Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Overtone (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (21, Unsplash: opening 1, programs 5, mentors 5, masterclasses 3, covers 6, stage 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the Menu button on phones cannot open the overlay. The footer repeats the section links, so every section stays reachable.
- The contact form posts to #contact and sends nothing; the thank-you line appears only through the small script. Connect a form service before publishing.
- In the covers shop the static, no-script and reduced-motion views show the disc with the last cover; the first row's cover shows only while the scene runs.
- The featured masterclass photo is loaded at 590 px wide and starts the scene scaled up, so the first frames of the shrink are soft. Use a larger photo for a sharper start.
- The reviews quote begins in a pale grey while it inks in; with the scene running the words are pale until they pass the middle of the screen.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Overtone left only in class names.
